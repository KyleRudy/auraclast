Alchemical,General,Transpuissant Industrial Miracle Upgrade ,1,1,Unique,,"Hair-thin wires threaded through the Alchemical’s body directly connect her Essence reservoir to one of her Charms, perfectly harmonizing it with her body and fundamental identity.","This Charm is unique, in that it needs not be installed in an array slot and is always active after being purchased. The Alchemical’s player selects a single standard Alchemical Charm, which is now permanently installed in the character’s Charm array without occupying a slot or counting against her installation limits. Transitory Augmentation of Industrial Endeavor, Sustained Augmentation of Industrial Endeavor, and Strain Resistant Chassis Modification are not valid selections.

The smoke quickly expands into a cloud encompassing everything within (Essence rating) zones of the Exalt. Those caught within the fog suffer a –3 penalty to all actions due to poor visibility and the fog’s choking, eye-burning properties. Everyone who breathes the fog must also soak two levels of automatic bashing damage per turn. The Alchemical is immunized against her own fog. It lasts for the rest of the scene, and does not move with the Exalt, though she may trigger this Charm again after moving to create a new smog and cover more zones."

When the need arises, this plate splits open and a tiny armature unfolds from within, bearing ammunition appropriate for whatever ranged weapon the Exalt is wielding. Generally the armature offers an Essence-sculpted crossbow bolt and loads it into the Alchemical’s weapon, but standard arrows and even throwing weapons no longer than the Alchemical’s forearm are possible.

When the Alchemical fingers its activation stud, it fires an explosive grenade of glowing, sticky alchemical glue.","Roll Dexterity + (Archery or Thrown) to aim this projectile, which has an effective range of two zones. Anyone struck by it suffers a –4 die penalty to all actions per coating until they employ a complex movement and reflexively roll Strength + Athletics (difficulty 9) to disentangle themselves. Webbed or otherwise “stuck” victims also treat all movement as complex, and cannot move at all with two coatings. Alternately, the Alchemical can use the grenades for utility purposes such as gluing a door shut, or creating a sticky trap on the floor that characters must use complex movement to bypass."

Alchemical,Combat,Body-Reweaving Matrix ,1,1,Superior,Stamina,"Hidden compartments scattered across the Alchemical’s body hide colonies of thumbnail-sized automatons shaped roughly like metallic spiders. When activated, these compartments open and the colonies awaken. Hundreds of the tiny machines swarm out across the Exalt’s body, clustering around any wounds they find. The automatons work quickly and tirelessly, spinning strands of unformed Essence that congeal into new matter. Where the spiders pass, they leave flesh and Charms restored to pristine condition.","Spend 2 Motes reflexively to activate this Charm. For the rest of the scene, the Alchemical reflexively heals 2 bashing or 1 lethal damage at the beginning of each turn.

Upon activation, and at the beginning of each subsequent round, select a particular foe or group as the focus of this Charm’s defensive calculations.

The Alchemical may take a second turn after all other characters have acted, using it to launch an attack at a target of her choice.
Alternately, spend 1 Mote and use the Alchemical’s turn to launch an attack against a group. The difficulty of this attack is lowered by –2, and if successful, it adds (Attribute used to attack) successes to its damage roll."
Alchemical,Combat,Impenetrable Repulsor Field ,1,1,Superior,Stamina,"Bulky brass power couplings in the Exalt’s shoulders feed out wires linked to crystalline repulsor arrays in her hands. When she activates this Charm, the Alchemical throws up a crackling, invulnerable force-burst capable of turning aside any attack.","Once per scene, when faced with an attack or similar form of danger, the Alchemical may declare that she perfectly parries it. The attack fails to strike the Alchemical without any further dice rolls. Area-of-effect attacks and the like harmlessly splash around her Essencefueled defense.

The Alchemical may reset the limitation of this Charm and make it available again by avoiding an attack without employing a perfect defense to do so."
Alchemical,Combat,Repeating Pneumatic Bow ,1,1,Superior,Dexterity,"When powered down, this Charm appears to be a bulky series of armored panels adorning one of the Alchemical’s arms. Upon activation, panels split aside and a heavy tubular mechanism folds out and extends its telescoping barrel just over the Alchemical’s wrist, even as four powerful metal stabilizing fins unfold around device. Tubes and wires connect this machine to the underlying supports and bulbous Essence capacitors housed inside the arm itself, carrying power and high-pressure steam. An activated Repeating Pneumatic Bow hisses from venting pressure valves and thrums ominously as it charges.","Spend 1 Mote and a turn in concentration to activate this weapon for a scene, or do so reflexively and at no cost if the character also has a Protosynthetic Ammunition Replicator installed. The Repeating Pneumatic Bow is an Archery weapon (Dexterity, 10L) with its own internal ammunition feed: it solidifies metal spikes from the Exalt’s own Essence and can fire them at targets up to three zones away.
Alternately, the Alchemical may spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower and make an Archery attack with this weapon against the highest Defense rating in a zone she targets, applying its result to everyone in that zone.

Alchemical,Combat,Subluminous Onslaught Missile ,1,1,Superior,Dexterity,"The Alchemical either replaces one entire forearm with a retractable cannon housing, or else her lower torso is a band of metal with an intimidating iris where her navel should be. When this Charm is active, either the arm transforms and repurposes into a cannon, or the iris opens to display a churning vortex of Essence, with thin armatures unfolding to brace the character in place against the violence of the weapon she is about to unleash. A moment later, the Alchemical fires a deadly lance of crystallized Essence at a significant fraction of the speed of light.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Dexterity + Archery to aim this Charm. It can strike at any target whose position the Exalt is aware of at distances of up to a mile, and can smash through walls up to a foot thick in order to reach him.

Upon inserting it into a target’s body, the Alchemical may take control of the subject’s mind, editing his memories to suit her needs.","The Alchemical must first insert the spike into her target. If he is restrained or cooperative, she may do so carefully, inflicting only superficial damage in the same fashion as a hypodermic needle.

(The spike is a Brawl, Martial Arts, or Melee weapon (Dexterity or Strength, 5L, although only Dexterity can be used for careful insertion.) Upon inserting the spike, the Alchemical reflexively spends 2 Motes and makes a contested roll of Manipulation + Presence against the subject’s Willpower (both at difficulty 6). The subject’s memories can be rewritten based on the number of successes left after subtracting the result of the opposed Willpower roll: 1 success: The events of a recent scene can be rewritten.
2 successes: The events of a recent day can be rewritten.
3 successes: A single pivotal memory in the subject’s life can be rewritten. Alternately, entire weeks of the subject’s past can be written so long as they’re not crucial to the substance of her life or identity.
4 successes: A major feature of the subject’s life can be rewritten (such as who he loves, where he was born, or whether the Alchemical is a hated enemy or a childhood friend).
