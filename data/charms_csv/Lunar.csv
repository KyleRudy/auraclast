Lunar,General Lunar,Excellence of the Shifting Moon: (Ability) ,1,1,,,"By suffusing herself with pure Essence, the Lunar pay perform incredible feats.","Select one Attribute when purchasing this Charm. At any time, the player may reflexively spend 1 Mote to add (the Attribute being rolled) in dice to all rolls using that Attribute for (Essence rating + 1) rounds in combat, or minutes outside of combat.
This Charm can be repurchased to unlock additional Attributes, but Essence must be spent to add dice to each Attribute separately. Lunars begin play with all versions of Excellence of the Shifting Moon which correspond to their Caste and Favored Attributes.
Lunar Attributes Unless it says otherwise, any Lunar Charms which modify something by a value equal to a Lunar’s Attribute use the dots permanently recorded on her character sheet for her human form when applying that modification, not the Attribute rating of whatever form she happens to be wearing. Thus, a Lunar with Strength 2 who turns into an elephant and uses Excellence of the Shifting Moon to add dice to a Strength + Brawl roll only adds two extra dice."
Lunar,General Lunar,Changing Plumage Mastery ,1,1,,,"The Lunar may recast her appearance through the application of Essence and will, making minor cosmetic changes to her body.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Appearance + Presence (difficulty 6). For each success, the Lunar may change one feature about her appearance from the following list: • Hair length, presence, and/or texture (including facial and body hair).
• Hair color.
• Eye color.
• Skin color.
• Apparent age.
• Height.
• Build and weight.
• Facial or bodily features (cheekbone structures, shape of chin, presence or absence of scars or tattoos, weathering, etc).
• The Lunar may transform her sexual characteristics, assuming a fully male, female, intersex, or androgynous or sexless body. This is no mere cosmetic transformation; if the Lunar gives their body reproductive organs, they are fully functional.
Changing Plumage Mastery can’t remove or alter the Mark of Luna or hide a Lunar’s moonsilver tattoos. If used on any of the Lunar’s true forms, the changes wrought by this Charm last until Changing Plumage Mastery is used again to manually revert them one by one, and are otherwise permanent. If used to alter any form from her shapeshifting library, the changes vanish once the Lunar shifts out of that form, and are not present when she next dons it. This Charm may be used repeatedly to stack up a dramatic number of alterations.
Gender, Pregnancy, and Shapeshifting Luna is traditionally styled as female in her titles, but has not shown offense at being addressed by any set of gendered terms regardless of the form she was wearing at the time — and those forms are often something other than strictly female. Is it any wonder her Chosen have an ambiguous relationship with sex and gender? While every Lunar is certainly born into a body with certain sexual characteristics, the Chosen of the Moon fundamentally have no “true” sex. Through the auspices of Changing Plumage Mastery and their shapeshifting library, they may be whatever they wish to be. Lunar shapeshifting is not an illusory process; a Lunar’s physical anatomy changes when she transforms herself, possibly into a different sexual configuration than the one she was born with, and usually into a different species as well.
As a result, Lunars have a complex relationship with the idea of gender. Many strongly identify with a certain gender (often but not always the one they were born with) and consider transformations that take them outside of their preferred body type to be temporary masquerades. Others take a more relaxed or fluid outlook, adopting the attitudes and expectations of whatever shape they happen to be wearing, or changing their internal self-image depending on their feelings of the moment without regard for their body’s current shape. A few consider themselves above the constraints of gender identity altogether and simply treat their mutable anatomy as a convenience to be shaped to whatever best suits their needs, or grant themselves forms that transcend or transgress binary divisions.
All that being said, pregnancy forms a particular concern since the Lunar shares her body with another being for its duration (or at least the potential for one; people in Creation are ensouled upon taking their first breath outside their mother’s body).
While any form with male anatomy is capable of impregnating others, in order to become pregnant herself, the Lunar must possess a womb in her true form, and may only be impregnated while wearing either one of her true forms or a shape of the same species as one of her true forms with the relevant anatomy. Usually what that means is that she can be impregnated while wearing other human guises via Prey’s Skin disguise. Usually. (Older Lunars tend to view sexual taboos of any kind as quaint and amusing.) Meanwhile, those who lack childbearing anatomy in their true form need not worry about becoming pregnant while wearing alternate forms from their shapeshifting library.
As to how much pregnancy constrains a Lunar, it mostly doesn’t. The Lunar is always visibly pregnant in her true forms once the process gets far enough along, but can hide the condition in other forms capable of childbearing by increasing the difficulty of the shapeshifting roll by +1. While doing so, or while wearing body configurations that lack a womb or are too small to accommodate the developing fetus, the child continues to gestate Elsewhere. If the Lunar decides to do away with her true form’s womb during pregnancy via Changing Plumage Mastery, this terminates the fetus as her body painlessly reclaims its borrowed flesh."
Lunar,General Lunar,Chimerical Ascension ,1,1,,,"Giving her flesh and mind over to the beast within her soul, the Lunar fortifies her rage form with additional beastly or otherworldly features. These new alterations need not match the Lunar’s Feral Heart. Though this Charm is, itself, relatively safe, the eldest members of the Silver Pact tend to keep those who cultivate it at arm’s length either out of distrust or because their hybrid form stirs up painful memories.
A character must know Chain-Eating Guise to learn this Charm.","The Lunar adds one new Aspect to her rage form. This Charm may be purchased as many times as desired, but while the Lunar has more purchases of this Charm than her Essence rating, she suffers one permanent Derangement (see p. XX) per purchase over that limit, as her mind is consumed by bestial impulses and instincts."
Lunar,General Lunar,Hide of the Cunning Hunter ,1,1,,,"Though it pains her to do so, the Lunar can forcibly hide the marks of Luna’s blessing upon her flesh.","The Lunar may spend 1 Mote and a turn in concentration to cause her moonsilver tattoos to vanish, becoming impossible to spot. Additionally, three successes are required to spot her Tell. Flaring her anima ends this Charm, causing her tattoos to burst into brilliantly illuminated visibility and stripping its protection from her Tell.
The Lunar may reflexively end Hide of the Cunning Hunter at any time she likes, making her tattoos visible and returning the difficulty to spot her Tell to normal."
Lunar,General Lunar,Humble Mouse Shape ,1,1,,,"The Lunar expands her shapeshifting prowess, learning to don the forms of animals smaller than a housecat. Forms taken with this Charm must still be easily visible to the naked eye, and so while mice and most spiders are valid, fleas are not.",This Charm’s effects are permanent. This Charm must be taken during character creation to have a Feral Heart smaller than a housecat. It is possible to use the Sacred Hunt to stock the character’s shapeshifting library with tiny forms prior to learning this Charm; they’re simply not usable until Humble Mouse Shape has been mastered.
Lunar,General Lunar,Hybrid Body Rearrangement ,1,1,,,The Lunar may conjure a particular beastly feature into whatever shape she currently wears.,"Spend a turn in concentration and roll the Lunar’s Essence rating against difficulty 7 to manifest one or more of her Feral Heart or rage form’s Aspects while wearing a different shape.
Alternately, reflexively spend 1 Mote to manifest the Aspects without need of an action or a dice roll. This feature remains present until this Charm is used again to dismiss it, or until the Lunar changes into a different form.
Hybrid Body Rearrangement can be repurchased as many times as desired. Each additional purchase adds a new Aspect to the Lunar’s options for this Charm, based on some form in her shapeshifting library."
Lunar,General Lunar,Intimate Training Recollection ,1,1,,,"The great limitation of the Lunar’s human faces is that she takes only the shape and not the knowledge. With mastery of this Charm, the Lunar may also snatch fleeting bits of knowledge from the human shapes in her form library. She must know Prey’s Skin Disguise to learn this Charm.","In a situation where the Lunar is in danger of being uncovered as an impostor because she doesn’t know something her current form’s original owner would have, or because she has said or done something incongruent with her current form’s personality, the Lunar may reflexively spend 1 Mote and make a Wits + Empathy roll to dredge the correct response to smooth things over from the depths of the shape’s history and to immediately enact it or blurt it out without any contextual understanding of what she’s doing or saying beyond knowing it’s the right thing.
Intimate Training Recollection can only be activated when the Lunar feels in genuine danger of blowing her cover. She can’t use this to go fishing for the form’s secrets, for example by having another Lunar leer suspiciously at her, because she knows there’s no real deception and no stakes attached to being found out."
Lunar,General Lunar,Monkey Arm Style ,1,1,,,"The Lunar may stretch any part of her body out, permitting her to strike or grab from a frightening distance. This Charm is normally used to enhance a character’s limbs, but might also grant her a long, flexible serpentine neck or even stranger anatomical transformations.","The Lunar might potentially lower the difficulty for interacting with hard-to-reach targets, as she can snake her body around corners or through twisty confines. She can launch Brawl, Martial Arts, and Melee attacks against targets in adjacent zones at +1 difficulty."
Lunar,General Lunar,Prey’s Skin Disguise ,1,1,,,"The Lunar expands her shapeshifting prowess. By performing the Sacred Hunt upon a human being, the Lunar may claim his appearance for her shapeshifting library.","Learning a specific human appearance works the same as hunting and consuming an animal form. The shapeshifting roll to assume a human skin is made at difficulty 7 rather than 6.
This Charm must be taken during character generation to buy the Stolen Faces Background."
Lunar,General Lunar,Rat-Head Technique ,1,1,,,"The Lunar can collapse her bones, allowing her to pour herself out of any sort of restraints or confinement, or even to squeeze through narrow pipes and cracks no larger than two of her fingers.","Spend 1 Mote to activate this Charm. For the rest of the scene, the Lunar can automatically escape from chains, ropes, or similar restraints if she gives up her action for the turn to concentrate on escaping, and can slowly squeeze herself through spaces that should be far too small to admit her as a form of complex movement. She may also use complex movement to move away from grapple-type powers and Charms such as Dragon Coil Technique, despite that they would normally immobilize her."
Lunar,General Lunar,Somnolent Statuary Method ,1,1,,,"The Lunar can press herself against an inorganic surface — a wall, a statue, the earth itself — and sink into it, merging with its substance and hiding perfectly within. She remains aware of her surroundings while inanimate.","Spend 1 Mote to merge with an object, which must be at least as large as the Lunar’s current form. Any serious disruption to the Lunar’s hiding place (smashing a statue, digging up the ground) ejects her, and she suffers a –2 penalty to her actions for a minute afterwards due to disorientation. Otherwise, she may voluntarily emerge from hiding whenever she likes. The Lunar ages at only half her normal rate while using this Charm."
Lunar,General Lunar,Towering Beast Form ,1,1,,,"The Lunar expands her shapeshifting prowess, learning to don the forms of great beasts of enormous size. Forms taken with this Charm may encompass any large animal, such as an elephant, whale, or mighty tyrant lizard.",This Charm’s effects are permanent. This Charm must be taken during character creation to have a Feral Heart larger than an elk. It is possible to use the Sacred Hunt to stock the character’s shapeshifting library with huge forms prior to learning this Charm; they’re simply not usable until Towering Beast Form has been mastered.
Lunar,General Lunar,Blood and Ash Masquerade ,2,1,,,"The Lunar shrouds herself in a deathly veil, making it easy to mistake the form she dons for one of the restless dead.","The Lunar increases the difficulty of a shapeshifting roll by +2 or increases the cost of a reflexive transformation by 1 additional Mote (making the cost to apply Blood and Ash Masquerade to her human or Feral Heart true forms 1 Mote in total). While she wears the enchanted form, it seems pale, drawn, and otherworldly. Unless given some reason to suspect otherwise, those who see her believe she is a wandering shade, ghost-animal, or other deathly spirit. Blood and Ash Masquerade lasts as long as the Lunar wears the enchanted form.
“Wandering about in broad daylight outside of the Underworld or a shadowland” generally counts as reason to be suspicious of a ghost, so this Charm is mostly useful for infiltrating shadowlands and the Underworld. Those who regard the Lunar’s guise with suspicion may make a Perception + Awareness roll against difficulty 9 once per scene to try to see through this Charm’s disguise."
Lunar,General Lunar,Dreadful Encore Performance ,2,1,,,"The Lunar’s body splits open and a human being drawn from her shapeshifting library climbs out of her. This doppelganger acts according to the Lunar’s will, displaying a very crude approximation of its original personality but lacking its original memories and skills. The Lunar must know Prey’s Skin Disguise and Intimate Training Recollection to learn this Charm.","Spend 1 Mote and a turn in concentration to manifest a person whose form the Lunar holds in her shapeshifting library. The person intuits the Lunar’s will and acts according to the purpose for which they were created; when their task is done, they will return to the Lunar and rejoin with her flesh, and she will gain any knowledge they learned while abroad on their task.
The Lunar loses access to the person’s shape while they’re separated from her, and if they are slain or otherwise prevented from rejoining the Lunar, she loses that shape from her library.
The person is treated as an antagonist with an Expertise pool of 5 dice relating to whatever their strongest Attribute was (if burly, to feats of strength and brawling; if pretty, to socializing and seduction) and a utility pool of 3 dice for all other purposes."
Lunar,General Lunar,Ox Dragon Charge ,2,1,,,"Driving herself into an opponent, the Lunar’s body momentarily grows an abundance of bony plates and spikes, increasing her mass and killing force.","When the Lunar advances into an adjacent zone and immediately makes an unarmed attack against someone in it, she may reflexively spend 1 Mote before rolling to transform her body into a living ram. The attack increases its base damage by +4 (or by +6 if the Lunar is already wearing a heavy form capable of devastating charges, such as a rhinoceros) and sends the target flying two zones away where he lands prone."
Lunar,General Lunar,Shadow of the Beast ,2,1,,,"The Lunar’s flesh roils, shudders, and disgorges a beast drawn from her form library, which moves and acts according to her will.","Spend 1 Mote and a turn in concentration to manifest an animal whose form the Lunar holds in her shapeshifting library (which is not her Feral Heart). The beast intuits the Lunar’s will and acts according to the purpose for which it was created; when its task is done, it will return to the Lunar and rejoin with her flesh, and she will gain any knowledge the beast learned while it was abroad on its task. The Lunar loses access to the beast’s shape while it’s separated from her, and if it is slain or otherwise prevented from rejoining the Lunar, she loses that shape from her form library."
Lunar,General Lunar,Tyrant Mouse Dominion ,2,1,,,"The Lunar may increase or decrease the size of any of her animal forms, becoming a bear capable of creeping in through pipes or a cobra of terrifying size.","When transforming into an animal form, either increase the difficulty of the shapeshifting roll by +1 or reflexively spend 1 Mote. The shape may be adjusted up to the scale of any beast the Lunar can hold in her form library (and so Humble Mouse Shape and Towering Beast Form significantly expand the scope of this Charm). An animal made much smaller than its normal size suffers –1 to its Strength and Stamina (to a minimum of 1), but +1 to Dexterity. A scaled-up form adds +1 to Strength and Stamina, but reduces Dexterity by –1 (to a minimum of 1)."
Lunar,General Lunar,Weapon-Snatching Coils ,2,1,,,"Upon upsetting an enemy’s grip with an attack, the Lunar’s body erupts with writhing tentacles, lashing pseudopodia, or coiling serpents, tearing the foe’s weapon from his grasp.","Once per scene, after successfully striking a target, the Lunar may forfeit two dice of damage and declare the target disarmed (see p. XX). Retrieving a disarmed weapon is considered a form of complex movement that forfeits the target’s ability to move to another zone that round, and cannot be done if the target is unable to move to another zone for any other reason (such as having been attacked before his turn). If the Lunar forfeits three dice of damage, she claims the weapon as her own and reflexively equips it.
Disarmed antagonists generally reduce their base damage to 1B. Natural weapons such as claws and fangs cannot be disarmed."
Lunar,General Lunar,Wondrous Lunar Transformation ,2,1,,,"The Lunar can transform another character by feeding them a bit of her blood, causing them to shapeshift into a human or animal shape from her form library.","The Lunar must feed her target a bit of her blood and spend 1 Mote. If she feeds them only a few drops, the transformation lasts for one hour. If she gives more than that, the transformation lasts for (number of levels of lethal damage suffered due to blood loss x Essence rating) days. If the subject doesn’t wish to transform, the Lunar must beat them in a contested Willpower roll against difficulty 6."
Lunar,General Lunar,Ant and Starfish Division ,3,1,,,"The Lunar splits herself asunder, creating independently active duplicates of herself.","The Lunar spends 3 Motes and a turn in total concentration to split off a clone of herself from her own flesh. The clone shares the Lunar’s personality, agenda, memories, Traits, and doesn’t consider itself to be an independent entity — it is, rather, a remote extension of the original Lunar’s identity and being. The clone shares the Lunar’s Charms and other powers, but both bodies must spend resources from a single Willpower and Mote pool, and any injuries inflicted on one of the Lunar’s bodies also appears on the other.
The Lunar may reabsorb her clone by spending a turn in physical contact with it, gaining all of its memories in the process. The Lunar may also cause her clone to denature into streamers of unraveling silver Essence at any time by spending another 2 Motes, which may prove necessary if it is captured, trapped, or otherwise in imminent danger of death, since any damage inflicted on the clone is also suffered by the Lunar."
Lunar,General Lunar,Becoming the Swarm ,3,1,,,"The Lunar can multiply her Essence again and again, becoming not merely a small creature, but a swarm of them. She must already have Humble Mouse Shape to learn this Charm, and must have a suitable creature in her shapeshifting library to become many copies of.","The Lunar concentrates for a turn and spends 2 Motes, then erupts into a swarm of small creatures: insects, rats, bats, nothing larger.
As a swarm, the Lunar becomes an environmental hazard that threatens everyone in the same zone she occupies. On her turn (as a swarm, the Lunar cannot cut ahead), if the Lunar chooses to attack then all of her enemies within the zone must make a successful roll to somehow fight off or avoid the swarm (the Attribute and Ability used are determined by whatever approach they take) against a difficulty of (3 + Lunar’s Brawl). Failure subjects them to seven dice of lethal damage, rolled once and applied to all affected targets. This damage can be enhanced by Charms which augment the Lunar’s natural attacks, such as Adder Fang Method.
The Lunar herself suffers a –2 penalty to her Defense and soak as a swarm, but cannot suffer more than a single level of damage from any attack that isn’t an area-of-effect attack or which doesn’t have special results when directed against groups. Once she suffers three levels of damage while she is a swarm, this Charm is forcibly terminated for the rest of the scene.
While the Lunar is a swarm, she cannot take advantage of any Charms which work by transforming her body (such as Hybrid Body Rearrangement), which grant her extra attacks (such as Vicious Hydra Transformation), or which create normal attacks with special properties (such as Ossific Shard Shot)."
Lunar,General Lunar,Internal Form Mastery ,3,1,,,"Through meticulous practice, the Lunar learns to master the art of shapeshifting.","The difficulty of all shapeshifting rolls, including those that are part of Charms such as Hybrid Body Rearrangement, are reduced by two."
Lunar,General Lunar,Quicksilver Second Face ,3,1,,,"With meticulous concentration and a great expenditure of divine power, the Lunar may redefine herself bit by bit.","The Lunar spends a moment in intense concentration and spends 3 Motes. She may subtract a dot from one of her Attributes and add it to a different Attribute within the same category (so she could trade a dot of Appearance for one of Charisma, but not for a dot of Strength). This can’t raise an Attribute above 5 dots or reduce it to 0 dots."
Lunar,General Lunar,Terrible Ogre Refinement ,3,1,,,"After rigorous communion with her predatory instincts, the Lunar learns to draw forth a second face for her fury. She must already know Chain-Eating Guise to learn this Charm.","The Lunar gains a second rage form, with different Aspects but otherwise conforming to the standard rules for rage form design. Any purchases of Chimerical Ascension upgrade both forms, and the Lunar need not choose the same new Aspect for both."
Lunar,General Lunar,Vicious Hydra Transformation ,3,1,,,"The Lunar transforms some portion of her body into a deadly serpent or serpents. Transforming one’s hair into a nest of writhing snakes is traditional, but a tail, the tongue, or even the fingers of one hand are also all potential options, along with other possibilities best not dwelled upon.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. At the end of the round, after all other characters have acted, roll an extra (Strength or Dexterity) + (Brawl or Martial Arts) attack with base damage 5L against a single opponent in the same zone. This Charm persists for the Lunar’s (Essence rating) in rounds."
Lunar,Full Moon,Adder Fang Method ,1,1,,"Dexterity,Intelligence,Stamina","The Lunar transforms her Essence into a debilitating poison and infuses it into her saliva, talons, or some other natural attack, the better to disrupt an enemy’s body.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote when the Lunar inflicts lethal or aggravated damage with a natural attack. This debilitating poison prevents the target from healing any damage, by any means, for a number of days equal to the Lunar’s Essence rating."
Lunar,Full Moon,Bear Embrace Method ,1,1,,Strength,The Lunar’s muscles surge as she crushes the life out of those caught in her grip.,"The Lunar locks herself in a deadly embrace with an opponent, immobilizing him and wrenching apart his joints one by one. By reflexively paying 1 Mote upon landing a successful unarmed attack, the Exalt locks herself and her target in place. Unless she voluntarily relinquishes the power of this Charm, neither can move from the zone they currently occupy until the Lunar has taken another (current form’s Strength rating) turns. The initial attack inflicts lethal damage, as do all subsequent unarmed attacks during the duration of Bear Embrace Method. While Bear Embrace Method persists, the Lunar may opt not to roll to attack her target if she desires, instead automatically scoring (Essence rating) successes with an unarmed attack on each of her turns.
Attacking anyone other than her grappled target immediately ends Bear Embrace Method. Each time the Lunar is struck by an attack, the duration of Bear Embrace Method is cut short by one round."
Lunar,Full Moon,Burning Venom Attack ,1,1,,Dexterity,"The Lunar may spit streams of sizzling, acidic venom at her enemies.","The Lunar is always armed with a Dexterity + Thrown weapon which can target opponents up to one zone away, with a base damage of 7L. She may employ this attack in any form which has a mouth."
Lunar,Full Moon,Deadly Assassin’s Claw ,1,1,,Dexterity,"The Lunar may break off fragments of her own body — her claws, her teeth — within an opponent’s flesh, there to work themselves toward the enemy’s heart.",Reflexively spend 1 Mote after successfully inflicting lethal or aggravated damage with a natural attack. The target must soak one automatic level of lethal damage per turn for the next (Wits rating) turns.
Lunar,Full Moon,Deadly Mantis Practice ,1,1,,Strength,"The Lunar suffuses her muscles with Essence, enabling her to fight with heavy weapons as though they weighed little more than feathers.","The Lunar may adroitly wield two-handed weapons using a single hand, allowing her to enjoy their enormous damage potential while taking advantage of freehand, sword and board, or dual wielding fighting style bonuses."
Lunar,Full Moon,Eagle Eye Advantage ,1,1,,"Dexterity,Perception","Observing her prey for a few moments, the Lunar’s keen instincts give her an infallible sense for where he will be just… now, in the moment she strikes.","If the Lunar takes no action at all during a round but to observe a specific opponent, then on her next turn she may launch an undodgeable attack against him. Protagonists cannot apply their Dodge defense. Directed against an antagonist, the attack roll lowers its difficulty by –2."
Lunar,Full Moon,Ferocious Biting Strike ,1,1,,"Dexterity,Strength","The Lunar’s attacks curve through the air as they seek out organ and artery, smoothly eliding her opponent’s defenses.","When the Lunar spends a point of Willpower to enhance an attack roll, she lowers the difficulty by an additional –1."
Lunar,Full Moon,Foot-Trapping Counter ,1,1,,"Dexterity,Wits","Matching herself to the rhythm of her foe’s movements, the Lunar hems in an enemy’s motions, preventing him from disengaging or running away.","When someone in the same zone as the Lunar tries to move to another zone, she may reflexively make a contested roll of Dexterity + Athletics against the opponent’s Dexterity + Athletics (both at difficulty 6). If the Lunar gains more successes than her opponent, they cannot successfully leave the zone during this round."
Lunar,Full Moon,Heron Sheds Rain ,1,1,,Dexterity,"The Lunar flicks away clumsy attacks with a dismissive toss of solidified hair, a casually extruded armored tendril, or by bending her joins to drift just out of the path of an assault not worth her full attention.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote to activate this Charm. For the next (2 + Essence rating) rounds, all attacks directed at the Lunar must discard one rolled success, and all attacks by antagonists must roll one more success than they otherwise would before adding a point to the attack’s damage (usually meaning that attacks must roll three successes per point of damage added)."
Lunar,Full Moon,Life of the Hummingbird ,1,1,,"Strength,Dexterity,Stamina","The Lunar may briefly teach her flesh the shape of another by drinking his blood, without adding that form permanently to her shapeshifting library.","If her target isn’t already bleeding, the Lunar needs to create a wound that inflicts at least one level of lethal damage, ideally using sharp teeth for simplicity’s sake. In any case, upon drinking a beast’s blood (or a human’s, if the Lunar knows Prey’s Skin Disguise), she may reflexively pay 1 Mote to assume his form. Once she shifts into a different form, she loses access to this temporary shape."
Lunar,Full Moon,Osseous Aegis ,1,1,,Stamina,The Lunar extends her skeleton into a broad bony shield protecting both of her forearms.,"Make a difficulty 7 shapeshifting roll by spending a turn in concentration and rolling the character’s Essence rating, or spend 1 Mote to reflexively transform without the need for an action or a roll.

Lunar,Full Moon,Predator Grace Method ,1,1,,"Dexterity,Wits",The Lunar moves with the grace and surety of a jungle cat on the prowl.,"The character needs never roll to maintain her balance, no matter how precarious her footing, and may stand or run upon even the weakest or most insubstantial of surfaces, such as falling leaves, individual threads, drops of rain, or even the surface of water. Reflexively spending 1 Mote makes her immune to falling damage for the rest of the scene, and ensures she always lands on her feet."
Lunar,Full Moon,Sinuous Striking Grace ,1,1,,Dexterity,"The Lunar allows her bestial instincts to guide her actions, leading her to strike when her foes least expect it.",The Lunar may reflexively spend 1 Mote to cut ahead without spending Willpower for the next (higher of Dexterity or Wits) rounds.
Lunar,Full Moon,Spider Climbing Technique ,1,1,,"Dexterity,Manipulation","The Lunar’s toes and fingertips subtly reshape themselves to exploit even the smallest imperfections in any surface, allowing her to scale sheer surfaces as easily as though she were traversing the ground.","The Lunar never needs to roll to climb any surface, and does not treat doing so as complex movement."
Lunar,Full Moon,Armor-Forming Technique ,2,1,,"Stamina,Intelligence",The Lunar extrudes her Essence into bone armor or a hardened carapace.,Reflexively spend 1 Mote and roll Willpower against difficulty 6. Each success grants the character 1 additional soak for the rest of the scene. This Charm doesn’t stack with itself; new activations replace older ones.
Lunar,Full Moon,Armor-Rending Claw Fist ,2,1,,Strength,"Exerting all of her force into an attack, the Lunar smashes through the toughest opposition as though it did not exist.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. Until the end of the current round, all hand-to-hand attacks inflict aggravated damage."
Lunar,Full Moon,Bounding Hare Evasion ,2,1,,Dexterity,"The Lunar ranges where she pleases, moving in quick bursts and bounds that confound the efforts of her foes to restrain her.","If an attack directed against the Lunar before her turn fails to strike her, it does not prevent her from reflexively moving to another zone that round. She may also do so even if an attack against her does succeed (Essence rating) times per battle. Moreover, she may respond to an attack, after it resolves, by reflexively paying 1 Mote, 1 Willpower to move into an adjacent zone."
Lunar,Full Moon,Crouching Tiger Exercise ,2,1,,Strength,The Lunar’s muscles bunch and surge as she feeds them Essence almost to the point of selfdestruction.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote to reduce the difficulty of a Strength-based roll by the Lunar’s Strength rating, or to add her Strength rating to the base damage of an attack. The Lunar suffers one level of unsoakable bashing damage after the enhanced action resolves."
Lunar,Full Moon,Ferocious Guardian Beast Stance ,2,1,,"Dexterity,Stamina","Synchronizing her Essence with the movements of a nearby comrade, the Lunar’s blade becomes a quicksilver flash, intercepting all harm that might befall her ally.",Reflexively spend 1 Mote to apply a protect action to a comrade in the same zone. This protection continues until one of the characters moves to a different zone.
Lunar,Full Moon,Flowing Body Evasion ,2,1,,Dexterity,"The Lunar flows like quicksilver away from an attack, parting her body around it if needs be.","Once per scene, when faced with an attack or similar form of danger, the Lunar may declare that she perfectly dodges it. The attack fails to strike her without any further dice rolls.
This defense cannot be invoked against unexpected attacks.
The Lunar may reset the limitation of this Charm and make it available again by incapacitating an opponent or causing a group to lose a point of Size."
Lunar,Full Moon,Hide-Toughening Essence ,2,1,,Stamina,"Growing accustomed to the rigors of an existence of hardship and toil, the Lunar conditions her body to resist injury.",The Lunar can ignore the rule of 1s on a number of soak rolls equal to her Essence rating per scene. She may decide whether or not to take advantage of this Charm on a given soak roll after rolling.
Lunar,Full Moon,Instinct-Driven Beast Movement ,2,1,,Dexterity,"The Lunar moves with terrifying speed and agility, inescapable in her pursuit of her prey.","The difficulty of all actions to run someone down, get somewhere quickly, or jump a difficult gap are permanently lowered by two.

Lunar,Full Moon,Lightning Stroke Attack ,2,1,,"Dexterity,Strength","The Lunar drives home a killing blow, faster than the wind and as unstoppable as an avalanche.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote before making an attack. The attack automatically hits, no matter how well the opponent defends or how poorly the Exalt rolls; if the dice indicate that the attack should not strike true, then it hits anyway, with no threshold damage. Lightning Stroke Attack can’t strike through a perfect defense such as Heavenly Guardian Defense, however, nor can it strike a target if there’s simply no way to reach them (such as if they’re on the other side of a wall, or outside of a weapon’s maximum range)."
Lunar,Full Moon,Ossific Shard Shot ,2,1,,"Dexterity,Stamina",The Lunar forms a sliver of her own skeleton into a deadly projectile and launches it into an opponent with devastating force.,Make a Dexterity + Thrown roll against an opponent up to one zone away. It inflicts a base lethal damage of the Lunar’s Stamina rating (based on her current form rather than the value on her character sheet). Using this Charm inflicts one automatic level of unsoakable lethal damage on the Lunar.
Lunar,Full Moon,Relentless Lunar Fury ,2,1,,"Dexterity,Strength","The Lunar unleashes her inner fury, letting her killing instincts guide her and insulate her from trivialities such as pain and danger.","Reflexively gain 1 Limit. The Lunar enters a killing rage, which she is able to direct against her enemies so long as no allies get in her way or try to restrain her. She becomes immune to wound penalties, lowers the difficulty of all soak rolls by –1, and may cut ahead without spending Willpower. Each round, she must attack one of her enemies if at all possible, and if she’s not in the same zone as an enemy, she must attempt to get into the same zone as an enemy. This frenzy lasts until all enemies are dead or fled."
Lunar,Full Moon,Scimitar Claw Technique ,2,1,,"Dexterity,Strength","The Lunar refines her natural weaponry into transcendental killing tools, adorning herself with a mouth crowded with teeth like daggers, and claws like gleaming machetes.","When transforming into a shape capable of inflicting lethal or aggravated damage with its natural attacks, the Lunar may increase the difficulty of her shapeshifting roll by +1 (or enjoy this Charm’s benefits automatically if she pays 1 Mote to assume the form). The enhanced form’s unarmed attacks inflict 8L base damage, or +2 damage if they would already inflict that much damage or more."
Lunar,Full Moon,Scorpion and Toad Mastery ,2,1,,"Manipulation,Stamina",The Lunar transforms her body into a transcendent poison.,"The Lunar cannot suffer more than one level of damage from being poisoned, no matter how potent it may be. By spending 1 Mote and spending a moment in concentration, she can use her Essence to flood her body with deadly toxins for the rest of the scene. Any being which bites the Lunar, drinks her blood, or eats her flesh must immediately attempt to soak three levels of lethal damage."
Lunar,Full Moon,Wary Swallow Technique ,2,1,,Dexterity,"The Lunar, sure-footed and with keenly tuned instincts, dances away from danger.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote to activate this Charm. For next (1 + Essence rating) rounds, each result of 1 rolled on attacks against the Lunar by a protagonist subtracts one from that attack’s base damage while this Charm is active. Attacks aimed at her by antagonists instead increase their damage by one point per three successes rolled rather than the usual two. Finally, all group attacks that the Lunar attempts to Dodge while this Charm is active do not add Size to their Expertise pool or base damage.
This Charm’s duration is (3 + Essence rating) rounds if the Lunar’s current form has a Dexterity rating of 6+."
Lunar,Full Moon,Chain-Eating Guise ,3,1,,"Dexterity,Stamina,Strength","The Lunar learns to wear her innermost fury upon her flesh, conjuring forth a battle form that is a terrifying mixture of human features and those of her Feral Heart.",The Lunar gains access to the rage form (see p. XX). It is considered one of her true forms.
Lunar,Full Moon,Coiled Cobra Stance ,3,1,,"Dexterity,Strength,Stamina","The Lunar draws down, tightening her muscles, marshaling her will, and maximizing her potential. When she strikes, it is like a thunderclap, an avalanche, a god taking the first step of the dance that ends the world.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower. For the rest of the round, if the Lunar adds any dice to a Strength, Dexterity, or Stamina-based roll with Excellence of the Shifting Moon, she bases the number of bonus dice on the physical Attributes of her present form rather than the value on her character sheet. She may also add her current form’s Strength to the base damage of all hand-to-hand attacks."
Lunar,Full Moon,Halting the Scarlet Flow ,3,1,,Stamina,"The Lunar’s Essence is a dynamo that will keep her up and fighting no matter what, beyond sanity and beyond the limits of bodily endurance. Her very rage pulls her back together.","Spend 2 Motes reflexively to activate this Charm. For the rest of the scene, the Lunar reflexively heals 2 bashing or 1 lethal damage at the beginning of each round. If she spends a turn taking no action save to concentrate on pulling her body back together, she can heal a level of aggravated damage."
Lunar,Full Moon,Octopus and Spider Barrage ,3,1,,Dexterity,"The Lunar moves like something out of primordial nightmare, either launching a flurry of attacks, or else splitting her extremities momentarily into several, perhaps even dozens, of darting tentacles and killing limbs.","Reflexively spend 2 Motes. The Lunar may take a second turn after all other characters have acted, using it to launch an attack at a target of her choice.
Alternately, spend 1 Mote and use the Lunar’s turn to launch an attack against a group. The difficulty of this attack is lowered by two, and if successful, it adds (current form’s rating of Attribute used to attack) successes to its damage roll."
Lunar,Full Moon,Ravenous Beast Maw ,3,1,,"Stamina,Strength","Upon defeating an opponent, the Lunar’s body grows a cavernous maw and clutching tendrils to feed his remains into it. She messily devours her foe, adding his strength to her own, even as she continues to battle on.","Upon slaying an opponent within the same zone or causing a group that overlaps into the Lunar’s zone to lose a point of Size, reflexively spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower. The Lunar immediately adds the slain target’s form to her shapeshifting library if she is able to do so (or adds a few generic soldiers or whatever else to her library if she tore through a group).
Moreover, she heals a number of levels of bashing or lethal damage equal to (1 + her Essence rating), prioritizing lethal damage first."
Lunar,Full Moon,Sensing the Deadly Flow ,3,1,,Dexterity,"Moving within the currents of violence, the Lunar’s keen instincts guide her through a multitude of blades to be where her foes’ attacks are not.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower to activate this Charm. For the rest of the scene, all attacks which the Lunar attempts to Parry or Dodge subtract one success from their total rolled, and the Lunar’s Dodge value is increased by +1. If this would raise her Defense above 9, her attackers are forced to discard an additional success from their attacks."
Lunar,Full Moon,Wound-Mastering Body Evolution ,3,1,,Stamina,"The Lunar’s flesh learns from that which harms it, adapting to temporarily become immune to a particular kind of damage.","After suffering damage, the Lunar may reflexively spend 2 Motes. For the rest of the scene, the Lunar cannot be harmed again by that sort of attack or damage source. If she activated Wound-Mastering Body Evolution in response to being slashed with a sword, she would become immune to being cut by edged weapons. If she activated it after being burned, she would be temporarily immune to flames. If she activated it after being punched in the throat, she’d become immune to being struck with unarmed attacks. If she activated it after being savaged by a wild beast, she’d become immune to claws and fangs. Ultimately, the Storyteller is the final arbiter of what a Lunar is or isn’t immune to while this Charm is active. Wound-Mastering Body Evolution cannot be stacked; activating it again while it’s already running simply changes what the Lunar is immune to."
Lunar,Full Moon,Writhing Serpent Defense ,3,1,,Dexterity,"The Lunar moves in deceptive and confusing patterns, tempting her enemies to overextend and expose themselves, then striking viciously.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, the first time each round the Lunar is targeted with an attack by an opponent in the same zone and it fails to strike her, she may make an immediate counterattack, forcing the attacker to soak the lower of (2 + Essence) or her current form’s Dexterity in levels of automatic damage (lethal or bashing as is appropriate for her current form of attack)."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Beast Calming Method ,1,1,,"Appearance,Charisma","By standing her ground and projecting a powerful and assertive energy, the Lunar may back down any lesser beast than herself.","The Lunar focuses in on a target and makes a Charisma + (Empathy or Presence) roll against a difficulty of their Willpower rating. Valid targets include all hostile animals, as well as any being in the grip of some sort of wild passion or frenzy. Success causes the aggressive state to immediately end, and the target to become calm. While mundane beasts affected by this Charm will never voluntarily attack the Lunar, this doesn’t guarantee that intelligent targets won’t still take violent actions, only that it won’t be the result of uncontrollable aggression."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Dog Tongue Method ,1,1,,"Charisma,Intelligence","The Lunar learns the trick of understanding the intentions and speech of animals, and can make herself understood to them in turn.","The Lunar reduces the difficulty of all Survival rolls when dealing with animals by two.
Additionally, she can employ human speech in any of her beast forms, regardless of the shape of her mouth or throat. Finally, she may spend 1 Mote to understand and make herself understood by animals for a scene."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Emotion-Shaping Technique ,1,1,,"Appearance,Charisma","By merely smiling, scowling, or otherwise emoting at her subject, the Lunar can afflict them with the pantomimed emotion. They are helpless not to feel it.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Manipulation + Empathy against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower. Their heart is filled with sorrow, fear, anger, despair, joy, apathy, contentment, or whatever else the Lunar wishes them to feel for one hour per success (see p. XX)."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Fearful Lunar Form ,1,1,,"Appearance,Charisma,Strength","When the Lunar decides to lean on someone, she subtly brings small aspects of the beast within into her appearance, putting a gleam in her eye and sharpening her teeth ever-so-slightly, finished off with a slight predatory musk.",The Lunar permanently reduces the difficulty of all attempts to intimidate others through social influence by two.
Lunar,Changing Moon,Freedom of the Beast ,1,1,,"Charisma,Wits","Realizing that she has formed an unwise attachment, the Lunar feeds her foolish sentiments to her Feral Heart, liberating herself thereby.","The Lunar gains 2 Limit and makes a Willpower roll against difficulty 7. If she succeeds, then she may erase an Intimacy of her choice."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Generosity of the Cuckoo ,1,1,,Manipulation,"The Lunar enwraps an object in her own alluring Essence, increasing its desirability tenfold.","When offering to give, sell, or barter an object to another character, spend 1 Mote and make a contested roll of Manipulation + Larceny against the potential recipient’s Willpower, both at difficulty 6. If the Lunar gains more successes, the target becomes convinced that whatever the Lunar is offering is of tremendous value. This impression lasts for a number of hours equal to the successes by which the Lunar’s roll beat her target’s."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Glance-Oration Technique ,1,1,,"Appearance,Manipulation","The Lunar can communicate even complex concepts with nothing but a sultry glance, toss of her head, subtly adjusted eyebrow, shrug, or other bit of body language.","The Lunar’s player may roll Appearance + (Presence or Performance) (difficulty 7) to communicate a message of any degree of complexity silently, through body language alone, and this communication is only perceptible to those she intends to understand her."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Heart-Drinking Allure ,1,1,,"Appearance,Charisma,Manipulation","The Lunar may briefly teach her flesh the shape of another by sharing physical intimacy with him. This Charm is normally used to temporarily assume human shapes, and doing so requires Prey’s Skin Disguise… but it can technically be learned without meeting that prerequisite.","The Lunar must share a minute or so in extended romantic intimacy with the target of this Charm. A deep kiss or a few intimate caresses are sufficient for its activation, but few Lunars stop there unless they’re in a hurry. Whatever the case, upon reflexively paying 1 Mote she assumes her partner’s form. Once she shifts into a different form, she loses access to this temporary shape."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Imposing Presence Attitude ,1,1,,"Charisma,Manipulation","The Lunar’s words, threaded with Essence, entrance and beguile.","By spending 1 Mote, the Lunar’s presence and words become deeply compelling. She reduces the difficulty of all social rolls by two (minimum of 4) for the rest of the scene."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Kindred Spirit Recognition ,1,1,,"Appearance,Intelligence,Perception",The Lunar becomes immediately recognizable to the outcast and the unwanted as a fellow traveler and potential friend.,"The Lunar lowers the difficulty of all social rolls by one when dealing with outsiders, outcasts, exiles, and those with no place in the society to which they must attempt to belong. This includes not only mortal outcasts such as the lepers, beggars, criminals, and those of deviant personal practices in highly traditional communities, but also supernatural outsiders: Exalts on the run from the Wyld Hunt, Wyld mutants without a tribe to take them in, bound demons, and the like."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Perfect Symmetry ,1,1,,Appearance,"The Lunar makes instinctive, subtle adjustments to the finest details of her appearance to best appeal to those she treats with.",Lower the difficulty of all Appearance-based rolls by one.
Lunar,Changing Moon,Righteous Lion Defense ,1,1,,"Intelligence,Manipulation,Perception","The Lunar shields her convictions in an invulnerable shell of Essence, guarding them against all hostile influence.","Any attempt to cause or force the Lunar to betray, undermine, or abandon her Intimacies automatically fails."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Silver-Maned Glory ,1,1,,"Appearance,Charisma","Howling an exhortation to push onward to glory, the Lunar stiffens the resolve of faltering allies.",Spend 1 Mote to make a reflexive rally action after an allied group has failed a rout check. This Charm can be used at no cost a number of times per story equal to the Lunar’s Essence rating.
Lunar,Changing Moon,Tale-Spinning Mastery ,1,1,,"Charisma,Intelligence","The Society of the Moon cherishes its oral histories, and teaches young Lunars to charge their tales with Essence to inspire listeners to greatness.","The Lunar recites a short story, fable, parable, or personal recollection, which the player should at least detail in broad strokes. Then, spend 1 Mote. Everyone who listened to the tale counts dice results of 10 as two successes on all actions that are in some way related to the moral or details of the story for the next 12 hours."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Wild Daughter Cultivation ,1,1,,"Appearance,Charisma",The Lunar cultivates the power of her Feral Heart that she might pass it on to her children.,"The Lunar may spend 1 Mote during the potential conception of a child to imprint it with the features of her Feral Heart, enduring that it will be beastfolk. If her body possesses an Aspect at the time of conception (such as from Hybrid Body Rearrangement, the rage form, or the Feral Heart form, although in that case the only thing this Charm is doing is to save the Lunar the hassle of going out into the Wyld…), her child will be beastfolk reflecting whatever sort of beast the Aspect came from."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Beast-God’s Blessings ,2,1,,"Manipulation,Intelligence","The Lunar devises a fertility rite and infuses it with her Essence. Those who deliberately couple under the auspices of the rite create a child that has been spiritually sired by the Lunar, even if she is hundreds of miles away at the time, and that child will be beastfolk.","Designing a fertility rite requires several weeks of research, the expenditure of 5 Motes, and a difficulty 8 Intelligence + Occult roll. Success produces a functional rite that the Lunar can pass down to her worshipers. This rite only works for members of her Cult, who regularly offer up reverence to the Lunar. Their children will be beastfolk, usually reflecting the Lunar’s Feral Heart, although she can assign some other beast identity from her shapeshifting library by increasing the difficulty of rite creation to 9.
Fertility rites lose their power over time, and the Lunar must devise a new rite once every ten years or so."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Chameleon Skin Disguise ,2,1,,"Appearance,Dexterity,Manipulation","The Lunar can shift her coloration to match her environment, becoming difficult to detect.","The difficulty of all Stealth rolls is lowered by two. By spending 1 Mote, the Lunar can intensify this capability for one scene (and causes its effect to spread to her clothing), making her functionally invisible so long as she moves no faster than a slow walk and doesn’t make any sudden, violent motions, which obviate the illusion."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Crowd-Inciting Method ,2,1,,Charisma,"The Lunar releases her ever-burning rage into the air around her: her breath, her very pheromones sizzle with anger, and those in her immediate vicinity react in kind.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Appearance + (Empathy or Performance) against difficulty 5.
Everyone present whose Willpower rating is equal to or less than the number of successes rolled becomes angry, aggressive, and combative for the rest of the scene (see p. XX)."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Earth and Moon Song ,2,1,,Charisma,"Lunars wear no chains, but rather define themselves, and defend that self-definition with unmatched ferocity.","Once per scene, when the Lunar takes an action to support, advance, or protect one of her Intimacies, that action’s difficulty is reduced by one."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Forgetful Victim Exercise ,2,1,,"Appearance,Charisma","The Lunar may blank out the memories of those she meets, either through terror or delight.","Spend 1 Mote and roll either Appearance + Socialize (if the target’s interaction with the Lunar was pleasant), or Charisma + Presence (if it wasn’t) against a difficulty of the victim’s Willpower. Each success allows the Lunar to erase the memory of one scene from the target’s life. No new memories take the place of these devoured moments; the victim’s mind simply develops blanks containing only a vague sense of bliss or terror."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Heart-Wasp Assault ,2,1,,"Charisma,Manipulation,Stamina","The Lunar transmutes her rancor into a swarm of stinging, biting insects. She opens her mouth and issues forth a medley of wasps, hornets, and biting flies to bedevil one of her enemies.","The Lunar opens her mouth, spends 1 Mote, and vomits up a torrent of stinging and biting insects which surrounds a foe of her choosing, either within the same zone or up to one zone away. For the next (1 + Essence rating) rounds, that opponent must soak one lethal damage per round and increases the difficulty of all actions by +2. If, before this Charm’s duration elapses, the target dies or flees somewhere that the swarm can’t follow (such as underwater), the Lunar may reflexively assign it a new target on her turn."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Laughing into the Teeth of Madness ,2,1,,"Appearance,Wits","The Lunar braces her Essence against the shapeshifting potential of her Exaltation, partially calcifying herself to gain protection from the corrosive influence of the Wyld.
Very few Lunars learn this Charm in the Age of Sorrows, as their moonsilver tattoos obviate the need for it. A few Casteless still rely on it to protect them during their sojourns into the kingdoms of the Fair Folk.","Upon activating this Charm, the Lunar’s maximum Mote pool capacity is reduced by one and the difficulty of all shapeshifting actions increases by +2, but she gains complete protection from being transformed in mind, body, or spirit by the Wyld. She may sustain Laughing into the Teeth of Madness for a number of days equal to her Essence rating, at which point she must make a difficulty 8 Wits + Occult roll. Success grants her another (Essence) rating days of protection, after which she has to roll again. Failure means she cannot sustain the tension in her Essence any longer. The Charm immediately ends, and can’t be reactivated for the rest of the current story."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Lion Roar Method ,2,1,,"Charisma,Strength","The Lunar draws in a deep breath, fills the air in her lungs with Essence, and then emits an earshattering, primeval roar.","The Lunar spends a turn producing an earth-shaking roar or ear-piercing scream.
Everyone who hears is that is not a friend or ally of the Lunar must succeed at a Willpower roll against difficulty 9, or else make all actions on their next turn at +2 difficulty as they stagger from the force of the Lunar’s cry. If this would increase the difficulty of an action above 9, they are forced to discard the first success they roll."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Mirror Sight Dismay ,2,1,,Manipulation,"Using her Essence as a mirror, the Lunar can use clever wordplay to reflect a target’s views back at them in reverse, briefly convincing them that something they believe is not true.",Spend 1 Mote and roll Manipulation + (Linguistics or Socialize) against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower. Success allows the Lunar to convince the target that one of his beliefs is false. This confusion lasts for 10 minutes per success.
Lunar,Changing Moon,Moon Beckons Tide ,2,1,,Appearance,"The Lunar fuses together pheromones, carnal allure, and her enchanting Essence to make her attention and her touch physically addictive.","The Lunar must share at least a minute in extended romantic intimacy with the target of this Charm, and then spend 1 Mote and make a contested roll of Appearance + Presence against the target’s Wits + Resistance, both at difficulty 6. If the Lunar gains more successes, her paramour becomes physically and psychologically addicted to her. She’s constantly in his thoughts, and he desires to see her and to be the focus of her attention again. He gains a positive Intimacy of some sort toward her, with a context chosen by his player. Spending more than (his Willpower rating) days away from the Lunar causes acute withdrawal symptoms: all dice pools suffer a –1 penalty that climbs each day until it reaches –3. At any point while suffering this penalty, the victim may spend 2 Willpower to make a Stamina + Resistance roll against difficulty 7. Succeeding once clears away the Intimacy. Spending the Willpower and succeeding again gets rid of the physical symptoms of addiction as well, and clears the penalty."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Natural Selection Glance ,2,1,,"Manipulation,Perception","The Lunar may focus her Essence to momentarily heighten all of her senses to an incredible degree and focus them upon one person, taking in their posture, scent, the rate of their heartbeat, and even, in the barest subliminal flash, the color of their soul. With nothing more than the blink of her eye, she may gain a summation of who that person is and what they’re currently doing.","Spend 1 Mote to immediately make an attempt to read the target’s intentions (see p.
XX) without the need for them to do or say anything revealing."
Lunar,Changing Moon,New Friend Aroma ,2,1,,"Appearance,Charisma,Manipulation","Perhaps it’s something in her pheromones, or simply her incredible confidence, but everyone who meets the Lunar regards her well.","During the scene when someone first meets the Lunar (or at least, when someone thinks they’re first meeting the Lunar) they’re favorably inclined toward her, and all her social actions against them are rolled at –2 difficulty."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Soporific Venom Injection ,2,1,,"Stamina,Manipulation",The Lunar distills a numbing venom from her Essence and imbues it into her attacks.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote when making an attack with a natural weapon which inflicts lethal or aggravated damage. If the target suffers even a single point of damage (and the Lunar may limit the attack to only a single point of damage, if she wishes), they must make a Stamina + Resistance roll against difficulty (4 + Lunar’s Manipulation) at the beginning of their turn for the next (1 + Essence) rating turns. Success allows the victim to fight off the venom and act that round, albeit at a –2 penalty. Failure causes her to fall unconscious for the rest of the scene."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Traceless Passage Technique ,2,1,,"Dexterity,Manipulation",The Lunar may smooth her passage through the world with an occulting expenditure of Essence.,"Spend 1 Mote. Until the sun next rises or sets, the Lunar leaves absolutely no evidence of her passage behind, making it impossible to track her using mundane effort. Those with supernaturally acute senses or supernaturally accurate tracking must still roll against difficulty 9 to follow the Lunar’s trail."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Animal Magnetism ,3,1,,"Appearance,Charisma,Manipulation","The Lunar wears her power and allure like a mantle, making her irresistible, terrible, compelling.","The Lunar gains access to a new form, the allure form. It is considered one of her true forms. Her allure form defaults to sharing the basic appearance of her human true form, though it may be independently modified with Changing Plumage Mastery. To assume her allure form, the Lunar concentrates for a turn as her player rolls the character’s Essence rating against difficulty 7, with success transforming her into a form of limitless appeal. Alternately, she may spend 1 Mote to reflexively transform into the allure form without a dice roll.
When wearing the allure form, the Lunar’s Charisma and Manipulation are increased by +2 and her Appearance rises by +3. These increases can raise her ratings above 5 dots. However, the difficulty to spot her Tell is reduced by two."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Brotherhood of Lake and River ,3,1,,Charisma,"The Lunar bonds herself to another through a mingling of blood and Essence. This Charm is traditionally used to unite a group of young Lunars as packmates, a bond considered blessed by Luna by much of the Society of the Moon.
Some Lunars, it must be admitted, use Brotherhood of Lake and River for less friendly purposes than to adopt those they feel a bond with as siblings. The Charm is also useful for keeping an eye on agents, victims, or stalking horses that the Lunar wants to keep on a long leash for the time being.","The Lunar and her sibling(s)-to-be must cut themselves (suffering one level of lethal damage) and bind the wounds together so that their blood mingles for at least a minute while the Lunar spends 1 Mote and all spend 1 Willpower.
Those united by a pack-bond can always dimly sense how far away their new siblings are, and in what direction. When a member of the pack is injured or killed, everyone she’s bound to knows it. Siblings within two zones of one another can even communicate silently, their words heard only within the minds of whichever other pack members they wish.
A character can be simultaneously bonded to a number of other characters equal to three times her Essence rating. The Brotherhood of Lake and River can be severed by two means. One is death. The other is for a participant to spit into her hand, spend a Mote of Essence, and slap the sibling she wishes to be severed from across the face."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Cobra Hypnotic Method ,3,1,,"Appearance,Manipulation","By maintaining eye contact with her victim, the Lunar may hypnotize them into doing whatever she likes. They will be aware their actions are unusual and inexplicable afterwards.","Spend 2 Motes and roll Manipulation + Presence against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower rating. One or two successes will allow the Lunar to command her target to do anything that doesn’t seem tremendously unusual or out of character. With three or four successes, she can command the target to do anything that doesn’t endanger himself or a loved one. With five or more successes, the target will risk his life and the lives of others at the Lunar’s command. The target will be aware his actions are unusual and inexplicable afterwards, unless the Lunar spends an additional 1 Willpower. In this case, the target will rationalize his actions to the best of his ability.
Cobra Hypnotic Method cannot hypnotize a target into harming or killing himself, compel him into certain death, or force him to betray his Nature. Protagonists targeted by this Charm may spend 1 Willpower to escape its effects for a scene if they can cite an Intimacy that it is forcing them to act against. Spending a number of points of Willpower equal to the Lunar’s Essence rating breaks the Charm’s hold."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Glib Tongue Technique ,3,1,,Manipulation,"The Lunar clouds her requests with a haze of Essence, making the unreasonable and the onerous seem entirely reasonable, at least for a little while.","When the Lunar requests someone to undertake an ordeal (see p. XX), she may reflexively spend 2 Motes and make a contested roll of Manipulation + Presence against the target’s Wits + Empathy, both at difficulty 6. If the Lunar gains more successes, the target sees the request as a mere inconvenience (see p. XX). After a number of minutes equal to the successes by which the Lunar beat him on the roll, he realizes the true magnitude of what she proposed, and if he agreed to it, may re-evaluate that decision as though now making it for the first time."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Mind-Blanking Fear Technique ,3,1,,"Charisma,Strength","The Lunar unleashes her rage in a single concentrated scream, stunning an enemy.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote and roll Charisma + Presence against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower. Success stuns them and causes them to be unable to use their next turn to do anything but defend themselves. If the Lunar immediately departs, they can’t bring themselves to follow after her for one minute per success rolled. A character can only be affected by this Charm once per scene."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Outlander’s Condemnation ,3,1,,Manipulation,"Crouching over a defeated opponent, the Lunar may drink the breath from his lungs and in doing so, consume that which ties her enemy to the world and his life. He is no longer recognized as kith or kin by those who knew him, and his fortune and privilege crumbles beneath him within a matter of days.","The Lunar draws breath from the lungs of an unconscious, sleeping, or otherwise incapacitated or unresisting target, then spends 2 Motes and rolls Manipulation + Socialize against difficulty 7. For each success, the target loses one social Background dot, starting with whatever he would consider most important. This broadly manifests as a sense of alienation: those who formerly accepted the individual no longer consider him “one of us,” whatever that might mean, and find excuses to exclude, disenfranchise, and disown him in short order.
Those with Essence rated at 2+ regain lost Background dots at a rate of one per week, beginning with those they have put the most effort into regaining, as their contacts and allies forget the strange and alienating distance that pushed them away from the character. Otherwise, this Charm’s effects are permanent unless the target takes substantial efforts to repair the damage to his life. A character may not be targeted by this Charm more than once per story."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Serpent-in-the-Belly Suasion ,3,1,,"Manipulation,Perception","The Lunar breathes directly into the mouth of another, solidifying her Essence into a serpent, spider, or rat that crawls down the target’s throat and nestles in his belly. There it listens to all that transpires, and possibly expresses the Lunar’s displeasure if it does not like what it hears.","To use this Charm, the Lunar must have access to another character’s mouth. Generally this is accomplished by using Serpent-in-the-Belly Suasion upon a sleeping target, in the middle of a lingering kiss, or at the culmination of a ritual involving the Lunar’s Cult, but it can be accomplished in combat by forfeiting all damage on a successful unarmed attack that would have otherwise inflicted at least three levels of it to momentarily seize the target. In any event, the Lunar spends 1 Mote, 1 Willpower, and the target is treated to the horrifying sensation of a beast sliding down his throat and nestling in his stomach.
The beast is immune to digestion and soon aligns itself with the target’s Essence flows, becoming undetectable in the course of normal activity. By shutting out all other stimuli and concentrating, the Lunar may hear whatever is going on around the host of a particular stomachspy. She has no access to the target’s vision, and any Perception + Awareness rolls she makes through her vermin spy suffer a –3 dice penalty due to the muffling of the host’s flesh.
The Lunar can at any time spend a turn in concentration and 1 Mote to command her embedded agent to express her displeasure; the host must soak three levels of aggravated damage, and suffers several minutes of excruciating agony that inflicts a –4 penalty on all actions as the beast within gnaws on his innards.
The Lunar may have a number of stomach-spies active at once equal to her Manipulation rating.
If she has no more use for one, she may reflexively sever her connection to it; it harmlessly disperses into its host’s Essence flows over the next several hours. Otherwise, the only way to remove an unwanted passenger is by accumulating five successes on an extended difficulty 9 Dexterity + Medicine action that inflicts two levels of unsoakable lethal damage per roll."
Lunar,Changing Moon,Unspeaking Aura of Dread ,3,1,,"Appearance,Charisma","The Lunar bristles with the Essence of a predator king, causing others to tremble at the thought of opposing her.","Spend 2 Motes. For the rest of the scene, any character who wishes to oppose, insult, demand something from, or attack the Lunar must either do so at +1 difficulty (discarding the first success they roll if this would push them above difficulty 9), or else spend a Willpower point to momentarily negate the power of this Charm for a turn."
Lunar,No Moon,Beast Instinct Method ,1,1,,"Intelligence,Stamina,Wits","The Lunar taps into her savage instincts, allowing them to help her exist with grace and ease in even the harshest of environments.","The Lunar needs never make a Survival roll to remain safe, comfortable, and fed in the wilderness. The difficulty to feed and protect others in such environments is reduced by three (minimum of 3). By spending 1 Mote, she fortifies herself against environmental damage so that she can suffer no more than a single level of damage from any particular source of it during a scene (such as from a particular snowstorm, forest fire, and so on)."
Lunar,No Moon,Blood-Reshaping Technique ,1,1,,"Appearance,Intelligence,Manipulation,Perception","By allowing someone else to drink her blood, the Lunar may dream a new appearance for them, or allow them to dream it for themselves.","The Lunar suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage and rolls Wits + Empathy against difficulty 7. Each success allows her to inflict one change on the person drinking her blood from the list found under Changing Plumage Mastery on page XX. The Lunar may choose these alterations herself, or may allow the subject to choose them. Alternately, if she rolls at least three successes, the Lunar may then spend 1 Mote to cause the subject to perfectly duplicate her own likeness.
One alteration of the Storyteller’s choosing will revert to its prior state after each week that passes, unless the subject spends a point of Willpower to keep it."
Lunar,No Moon,Calls of the Human Prey ,1,1,,Intelligence,The Lunar may refine the subtleties of language from the heady tang of blood.,The Lunar can learn a single language from anyone whose blood she drinks or whose flesh she devours.
Lunar,No Moon,Debt of Borrowed Skin ,1,1,,"Charisma,Manipulation,Intelligence,Wits",The Lunar may barter or gamble for someone else’s face. She must know Prey’s Skin Disguise to learn this Charm.,"The Lunar makes it explicitly clear that she wishes to purchase the right to wear the subject’s face, and must provide him with compensation he feels is adequate. Upon doing so, she gains the right to transform into his shape precisely once. After doing so once and then shifting into a different form, the subject’s shape is erased from her shapeshifting library. She may make another deal in the future, if she wishes, but cannot stockpile multiple unused bargains with the same individual.
Alternately, she may steal her target’s form by defeating him in a game of chance or skill, if he’s willing to wager his face. The Lunar is free to cheat, so long as she doesn’t get caught. This variant of the Charm is subject to all of the above restrictions."
Lunar,No Moon,Eyes of the Cat ,1,1,,"Intelligence,Perception","The character may attune her senses to otherworldly emanations, glimpsing the ghosts as they haunt their graves and the gods in their temples. Having seen such spirits, she may also strike them.","Spend 1 Mote. The Lunar may see dematerialized beings and the entrance of spirit sanctums for the rest of the scene. She may also physically interact with dematerialized beings, including attacking them."
Lunar,No Moon,Form-Fixing Method ,1,1,,Wits,"The Lunar scratches or paints stabilizing glyphs upon the surface of an object, immunizing it against the Wyld’s corrosive touch. Some hold that this humble and very ancient Charm was the seed from which the modern Lunar caste-fixing rituals were devised.",Spend 1 Mote and make a Wits + Craft roll against difficulty 6. Success protects the object from the influence of the Wyld so long as the markings upon it are undisturbed.
Lunar,No Moon,Hackle-Raising Exercise ,1,1,,Perception,"The Lunar’s senses are ever-attuned to danger, warning her when she is about to be struck down.","After the Lunar fails to notice an ambush or other such unexpected attack, she may reflexively spend 1 Mote to notice it anyway, allowing her to defend against it."
Lunar,No Moon,Harmony with Reality Technique ,1,1,,Intelligence,"By giving a gift of her Essence, the Lunar may harmonize a prodigy of the Wyld with the solidity of Creation.","The Lunar touches a fantastic marvel of the Wyld such as a flower made of delicious fire or a sword forged of solidified love and spends 1 Mote, infusing it with her protean Essence.
The enchanted object may be carried into Creation without losing any of its fantastic or impossible qualities, and may endure there for a year and a day, or even longer if this Charm is used again to extend the duration of its protection. By spending 3 Motes, the Lunar may grant this blessing to a Wyld-touched being too fantastic or badly mutated to survive beyond the bordermarches, granting them protection from the grinding touch of reality for (Essence rating) months."
Lunar,No Moon,Labyrinth of the Beast ,1,1,,Intelligence,"The Lunar hides her thoughts within an Essence-sculpted warren, leading those who would try to steal them astray.","Whenever someone attempts to read the Lunar’s mind by any means, roll Perception + Awareness against difficulty 6. Success reveals not only the mind-reading attempt, but also who is responsible. The Lunar may then pay 1 Mote to reflexively shield her thoughts, making them impossible to read for the rest of the scene."
Lunar,No Moon,Lore-Speaking Method ,1,1,,None,"This Charm was devised in tandem with the new Lunar Castes. Learning and enacting it is one of the most holy rites of the No Moon Caste. Any No Moon who has not yet mastered the LoreSpeaking Method is looked upon as a child by her peers — not with contempt, but as someone who is not yet ready to assume the responsibilities and obligations of her caste.
Lore-Speaking Method is enacted by reciting a litany of ancient wisdom in the form of a mythcycle: an oral history of the Lunar Exalted from the first-blessed of Luna, across the lofty heights of the First Age, the terrible tribulations that followed, and on to the modern day and the Lunar performing the recitation itself.
Subtly encoded into the telling is everything the Lunar speaking it knows: all of her experience, wisdom, and secret knowledge of the world. Moreover, the recitation also contains the accumulated wisdom of every Lunar that has ever spoken it. In short, Lore-Speaking Method encapsulates the sum collected knowledge and lore of the Society of the Moon in its totality.
A number of First Age survivors consider exposing any non-Lunar to a recital of Lore-Speaking Method to be a direct betrayal of the Society of the Moon, punishable by death.","Lore-Speaking Method’s recital requires the expenditure of 3 Motes and at least four hours of uninterrupted speech, pantomime, shapeshifting, and phantasmal landscapes sculpted from the speaker’s anima. The wisdom it encodes into its listener is entirely subliminal and inaccessible aside from the broadest strokes of the surface history of the Lunars. While other Charms draw on the foundation it builds, all Lore-Speaking Method does on its own is enable the listener to learn it, and permit his next expenditure of normal or supernal experience points to purchase an Attribute or Ability at Favored cost discount if the Lore-Speaker possesses that trait as a Caste or Favored Attribute or Ability. This benefit can only be enjoyed once per story.
While No Moons are the only Lunars expected to learn this Charm, other castes are capable of it.
Any Lunar who has received her tattoos and gone through a traditional mentorship and induction into the Society of the Moon has already been exposed to Lore-Speaking Method."
Lunar,No Moon,Tattoo-Carving Wisdom ,1,1,,None,"This powerful Charm is used, after a period of extensive trials and ordeals which clearly display a young Lunar’s aptitude, to fix her Caste by marking her with moonsilver tattoos.","Spend 5 Motes and spend six hours applying the tattoos with painstaking care. The underlying pattern the young Lunar’s Essence has assumed over the course of the trials guides the shape and placement of the tattoo patterns, so that they always reflect and complement her caste, attitude, and the shape of her body. A Lunar’s caste may differ from incarnation to incarnation, rather than being intrinsic to the Exaltation in the fashion of Solar or Sidereal Exaltation.
This Charm requires a supply of materials to be set aside before it can be enacted, but even ordinary silver will do. During the course of the Charm, the metal is transformed into purest moonsilver as the Lunar touches it with her tattooing tools: a miracle that the designers of the Charm interpreted as Luna’s personal blessing of approval over their endeavors.
There is no mechanical benefit for using this Charm, save for granting a young Lunar her protective tattoos and fixing her caste. However, while Lunar convention holds that a freshlytattooed Exalt does not owe the one who fixed her caste any sort of repayment, it’s common for older members of the Society of the Moon to present discreet gifts or favors to a tattooist who is young enough herself to be in need of such things, in recognition of her labors.
Although this complex Charm is traditionally only passed down to No Moons, any Lunar is capable of learning it."
Lunar,No Moon,Terrestrial Circle Sorcery ,1,1,,Intelligence,The Lunar has been initiated into the practice of sorcery. She can cast Terrestrial Circle spells and enact sorcerous workings. Purchase of this Charm grants one shaping ritual and one Terrestrial Circle spell.,See Chapter Eleven for rules on playing a sorcerer.
Lunar,No Moon,Tool Hand Technique ,1,1,,Intelligence,"Focusing her malleable Essence into her hands, the Lunar can harden and reshape flesh and bone to suit the needs of the moment.","Spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, the Lunar may spend a moment concentrating to reshape her hands into whatever sort of tool she needs, from hammers and clamps to lockpicks to bone saws."
Lunar,No Moon,Sense-Borrowing Method ,1,1,,Perception,The Lunar may cast her Essence into a person or animal and perceive as they do.,"Spend 1 Mote to target a creature the Lunar can see, then roll Perception + Awareness against a difficulty of their Willpower. The Exalt can ride her target’s senses for one hour per success gained. She can remain active while borrowing the senses of another, but raises the difficulty of all actions by +2 due to distraction. If either the subject or the Lunar has tasted the other’s blood in the past, she may waive the Charm’s Essence cost."
Lunar,No Moon,Sense-Sharpening Change ,1,1,,Perception,"The Lunar coaxes subtle transformations out of her flesh to give herself the keen senses of a menagerie of beasts. Her nose might develop the convoluted ridges of a bat when she scents the air, or her eyes become those of a hawk when she peers at something.","The Lunar must spend a turn in concentration to activate or banish this Charm. While it is active, the difficulty of all Perception rolls drops by three, to a minimum of difficulty 4."
Lunar,No Moon,Breath-Drinking Executioner Attack ,2,1,,"Intelligence,Perception","The Lunar may suck the breath out of a foe, absorbing their will and perhaps even their very lifeforce.","The Lunar must be in control of her enemy; either they must be incapacitated, restrained, unconscious, or for some reason unable to leave the Lunar’s current zone during this round or the round following (such as when restrained by Bear Embrace Method). The Lunar spends a turn drawing out the opponent’s breath, spends 1 Mote, and rolls Wits + Athletics, contested by the target’s Stamina + Resistance (both difficulty 6). Each success by which the Lunar exceeds her opponent causes the target to lose 1 point of Willpower (or, in the case of antagonists, to lower their Resolve by –1 for the rest of the story). The Lunar gains 1 point of Willpower for every 3 points the enemy loses. If this Charm reduces a mortal opponent to 0 Willpower or Resolve, they immediately perish, while supernatural beings are knocked out until the end of the scene.
The dead and beings which need not breathe are immune to this Charm."
Lunar,No Moon,Celestial Circle Sorcery ,2,3,,Intelligence,The Lunar has been initiated into the mighty workings of the Celestial Circle of sorcery. She can cast Celestial Circle spells. Purchase of this Charm grants one shaping ritual and one Celestial Circle spell.,See Chapter Eleven for rules on playing a sorcerer.
Lunar,No Moon,Devil-Restraining Grip ,2,1,,"Intelligence,Perception","Clenching her fist, the Lunar entangles a spirit in a snare of Essence and drags it bodily into the physical world.","Target a dematerialized being the Lunar can perceive and spend 1 Mote, then make a contested Willpower roll against difficulty 6. If the Lunar gains more successes, the god, ghost, demon, or whatever it may be is immediately forced to materialize and remain in that state for the rest of the scene."
Lunar,No Moon,Dreaming Wisdom Revelation ,2,1,,None,"The Lunar retreats from all distractions to enter a meditative state in which she sinks into the tumultuous and savage core of her Exaltation, drinking deep of the well of wisdom embedded within her Essence.
Lunar Essence is a dangerous and volatile thing, and descending into the accumulated memories of all of Luna’s children is a harrowing experience. This Charm is generally entrusted to No Moons, with members of other castes expected to petition them for its use on their behalf — and to compensate them for doing so.
A character must have listened to a recital of Lore-Speaking Method at least once in order to learn this Charm.","Using this Charm requires at least an hour of undisturbed seclusion and the expenditure of 3 Motes, 1 Willpower. The Lunar may make an Intelligence + Lore roll to recall a fact as though she possessed the memories of every Lunar who has ever learned Lore-Speaking Method, with the difficulty set by the age and obscurity of the knowledge sought. Each success rolled grants the Lunar incredibly precious knowledge… and one point of Limit.
It's possible to use this Charm to plumb the dark personal secrets of other Lunars, but doing so is a very good way to make powerful enemies. A Lunar can make a reflexive Perception + Lore roll at difficulty 8 whenever someone uses this Charm to consult her most personal memories; one success lets her know that someone has done so, while three or more successes tells her precisely what information was retrieved, and five or more successes lets her know who received it.
Magic which protects a Lunar from mind-reading can’t stop other Lunars from accessing knowledge through Dreaming Wisdom Revelation. Wisdom granted to the communal pool of the Charm is irrevocable."
Lunar,No Moon,Knowing the Arrow’s Path ,2,1,,"Perception,Wits",The Lunar’s ever-keen senses constantly track and calculate every possible trajectory along which a projectile might travel to strike her. She then does her best not to intersect those points during battle.,Reflexively spend 1 Mote to raise the difficulty of all Archery and Thrown attacks against the Lunar for the rest of the scene by +1.
Lunar,No Moon,Lick Wound ,2,1,,"Intelligence,Wits",The Lunar bring relief and healing by lapping her tongue at an ally’s wounds or blowing her Essence-infused breath into their injuries.,"For each Mote of Essence spent powering this Charm, the subject transforms one level of lethal damage into bashing damage, or immediately heals one level of bashing damage outright. For each two Motes spent, one level of aggravated damage becomes a level of lethal damage. The Lunar can use this Charm on herself, but doing so costs a point of Willpower."
Lunar,No Moon,Life Without Chains ,2,1,,Wits,"Letting a surge of unbridled rage rip through her psyche, the Lunar shatters any magic that attempts to enslave her mind.","Reflexively spend 2 Motes to become immune to all thought and emotion-altering magic for the rest of the scene. If used in response to an attempt to use such magic upon the character, the Lunar either gains 2 Limit or is compelled to attack the responsible creature until it has died or fled, or until the scene ends."
Lunar,No Moon,Penumbral Self Meditation ,2,1,,"Intelligence,Manipulation,Wits","The Lunar fortifies her mind with a momentary taste of future bliss, dreaming and almost touching a vision of a cold, dark, and beautiful night under which she might run free under the frosted light of the moon, without compunction, without constraint.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, Willpower rolls are not subject to the rule of 1s. If a Willpower roll fails anyway (or is defeated in a contested roll), the Lunar gains a point of Limit as her dream of future liberation blows away in tatters and seems unattainable."
Lunar,No Moon,Pulse of the Invisible ,2,1,,"Intelligence,Perception","The Lunar attunes her senses to the subtle flows of Essence itself, sensing its active manifestations in the form of what mortals call magic.","The Lunar can roll Perception + Occult against difficulty 8 to survey the Essence of the world around her. Depending on the number of successes rolled and the presence of anything interesting to detect, she might uncover things like the radiance of a nearby Manse or Demesne, a subtle but active spell or sorcerous working, or the fact that a ferocious amount of Essence was spent in the area sometime recently. She can also discern particular profiles, flavors, or “colors” of Essence if she has encountered them before, and thus might use this Charm to track a missing Circlemate by the trail of his expended Essence."
Lunar,No Moon,Resisting the Lure of Madness ,2,1,,Wits,The Lunar trusts to her own inherent mutability to slip free of any attempts to taint her Essence.,"Whenever the character is the subject of any supernatural power that seeks to transform, infect, taint, transport, or control her body or spirit, or to alter her destiny or her place in the world (such as by magically altering her Backgrounds), she may reflexively spend 1 Mote and roll Wits + Occult against difficulty 7. Success shatters the hostile magic, protecting the Lunar completely."
Lunar,No Moon,Spirit-Maiming Essence Attack ,2,1,,"Intelligence,Wits",The Lunar imbues her strikes with Essence which negates the coherence of the otherworldly.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the next (1 + Essence rating) rounds, all the Lunar’s attacks inflict aggravated damage to gods, elementals, demons, ghosts, and other beings not clothed in flesh."
Lunar,No Moon,Twin Beasts Dancing ,2,1,,"Charisma,Wits",The Lunar draws upon her bond with an animal companion to exchange places in the world with her Familiar.,"Spend 1 Mote and a turn in concentration, or 1 Mote, 1 Willpower to enact this Charm reflexively. At the end of the next round, the Lunar shapeshifts into her Familiar’s form, while her Familiar shapeshifts into the Lunar, causing the two to switch locations."
Lunar,No Moon,Weapon-Shaping Prana ,2,1,,"Intelligence,Wits","By picking up a bit of wood, stone, or bone and infusing it with her Essence, the Lunar may reshape the object into a deadly weapon.","Spend a turn in concentration to transform a stone, bone, or hunk of wood into a fully functional mundane weapon. Alternately, spend 1 Mote to reflexively transform it instantly."
Lunar,No Moon,Blood on the Wind ,3,1,,Perception,"No one, no matter how clever or desperate, can evade the Lunar once she has their scent.","If the Lunar can find any sort of sign that a being she wants to find has been in her present location, she can infallibly trace his steps from there to wherever he is now, following a mixture of scents, subtle signs of his passage, and when all else fails, the dim impressions of his Essence. No roll is needed. The Lunar’s tracking is supernaturally perfect.
Normally, the Lunar must cast about and carefully examine her quarry’s trail to follow it with Blood on the Wind, but by paying 1 Mote she can track as swiftly as she can move until the sun next crosses the horizon."
Lunar,No Moon,Breath-Regaining Exercise ,3,1,,"Intelligence,Perception",The Lunar focuses her breathing into a ritual pattern which conjures up precious motes of power from her Exaltation as the moon calls forth dew upon a flower’s petals.,"The character must spend at least an hour in meditation, spend 1 Willpower, and roll her Willpower rating against difficulty 9. Each success rolled restores 1 Mote of Essence. This Charm can’t be used again until the moon has risen and set."
Lunar,No Moon,Ecstatic Inspiration Satori ,3,1,,"Intelligence,Perception,Wits","The Lunar fills herself with the wisdom of the great beasts, the dark moon, and the tribulations of her people.
A character must have experienced the litany of Lore-Speaking Method to learn this Charm.","The Lunar gains access to a new form, the mystic form. It is considered one of her true forms. Her mystic form defaults to sharing the basic appearance of her human true form, though it may be independently modified with Changing Plumage Mastery. To assume her mystic form, the Lunar concentrates for a turn as her player rolls the character’s Essence rating against difficulty 7, with success transforming her into a form of dark wisdom. Alternately, she may spend 1 Mote to reflexively transform into the mystic form without a dice roll.
When wearing the mystic form, the Lunar’s Perception and Wits are increased by +2 and her Intelligence rises by +3. These increases can raise her ratings above 5 dots. However, the difficulty to spot her Tell is reduced by two."
Lunar,No Moon,Flesh Sculpting Art ,3,1,,Intelligence,"The Lunar may sculpt living flesh and bone as though it were modeling clay, creating masterworks or horrors as her whims and skills dictate.","The Lunar’s subject must either willingly submit to her ministrations or else be restrained. Using this Charm is neither fast nor painless. The Lunar’s hands sink into her subject’s flesh as though it were made of water until she finds an organ, strand of muscle, bit of ligament, or bone that interests her. That… she is able to seize. And stretch. And mold. And reshape. Spend 2 Motes and make a (Dexterity or Intelligence) + Medicine roll against difficulty 7. If the Lunar is successful, then after an hour of work, she can impose one Lunar Aspect on the subject. These are never beautiful or elegant: the “wings” Aspect, for example, does not grant the target swan wings, but rather hideous membranes extruded from his back and made of repurposed skin, ribs, musculature, and ligaments. Alternately, the Lunar can simply reduce the target’s Appearance rating by one. A subject can sustain up to (Stamina) treatments from this Charm; any more will kill her at the end of the current story, her anatomy too severely altered to sustain her life.
Alterations inflicted with this Charm upon mortals are permanent unless the Lunar chooses to use Flesh Sculpting Art again to undo them. Beings with supernaturally effective healing, such as the Exalted, revert alterations as though they were healing a level of aggravated damage to a –5 health box."
Lunar,No Moon,Lessons in the Blood ,3,1,,"Intelligence,Perception","All that a person is or has ever been dwells within their blood and flesh, and the Lunar learns to taste these lessons.","Spend 2 Motes while drinking someone’s blood or devouring their flesh (at least one level of lethal damage, minimum; a single drop of blood isn’t enough for this Charm), and roll Perception + Awareness against difficulty 7. Each success allows the Lunar to harvest one Ability dot from the target, which she may add to her own Abilities. The Lunar can’t raise an Ability higher than the target’s rating. These stolen dots persist for 24 hours."
Lunar,No Moon,Secure Den Dream ,3,1,,Wits,"The Lunar dreams, and in her dreams creates a world shaped after the fiercest needs and desires of her heart. When she wakes, she senses a doorway within her, which she may place somewhere in the world by standing in an empty portal — the arch of a tree root, or a door frame with no door, or an open window — and whispering the secret name of her den-realm.","The Lunar creates a small spirit sanctum, and may spend 5 Motes to place a gateway leading to it somewhere in the world. She can pass through that gateway by simply concentrating for a turn while touching it, and may exit in the same way. The gateway is invisible and intangible to everyone who can’t see dematerialized beings, and generally works exactly like a spirit’s sanctum.
The Lunar can relocate the entrance to her sanctum if she wishes, touching it and spending 3 Motes to “swallow” it back into her Essence, and then spending another 5 to disgorge it again somewhere else.
The sanctum is always a few miles of habitat natural to the Lunar’s Feral Heart (such as marshland for an alligator Lunar, or jungle for a tiger Lunar), with a small temple in its center decorated to suit the Lunar’s interests and aesthetic preferences."
Lunar,No Moon,Truth-Scenting Method ,3,1,,Intelligence,The Lunar recoils when she detects the stink of deceit. Woe betide those who would persist in such folly.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote to interrogate a statement made to the Lunar. If the speaker is intentionally attempting to speak falsehood, the Lunar detects it as a terrible stench. Moreover, she learns something of the nature of the liar, and her next roll directed against him is made at –1 difficulty."
Lunar,No Moon,Walking Between Worlds Methodology ,3,1,,Intelligence,The Lunar learns to find the secret ways that wind between worlds.,"The Lunar may find a crack in the space between Creation and what preceded it. She must locate a corpse, grave site, memorial, or other place that is directly touched by or which commemorates death in order to use this Charm. Then she spends 3 Motes and rolls Intelligence + Occult against difficulty 8. Success allows her to open a storm-swept crack into the Underworld at that location, and to lead through a number of willing followers equal to the successes rolled. This Charm cannot bring a Lunar from the Underworld to the lands of the living: she must find a shadowland if she wishes to return."
Lunar,No Moon,Wearing the Pantheon’s Face ,3,1,,Intelligence,"The Lunar descends into the archival records of the Society of the Moon and dredges from its depths not wisdom, but a purloined form: the face of another of Luna’s children.
Young Lunars are advised to be very cautious about the deeds they perform while wearing another Lunar’s identity. Broadly speaking, the Society of the Moon doesn’t frown on the simple use of this Charm — Luna smiles on those who cheat creatively — but they also don’t frown on elders knocking the hell out of young upstarts who disrupt their plans or sully their reputations by impersonating them. A Lunar is considered to have an ironclad right to present herself as any of her own former incarnations.
A character must have listened to a recital of Lore-Speaking Method at least once in order to learn this Charm.","Using this Charm requires at least an hour of undisturbed seclusion and the expenditure of 1 Mote, 1 Willpower. The Lunar assumes the true face of another Lunar Exalted, either living or dead. This may be any of the Lunar’s true forms. The Lunar does retain her own Tell, but is considered to be wearing a form from her shapeshifting library rather than a true form during this masquerade.
A Lunar can make a reflexive Perception + Larceny roll at difficulty 8 whenever someone uses this Charm to wear one of her faces; one success lets her know that someone has done so, while three or more successes tells her precisely where that Lunar is, and five or more successes lets her who that Lunar is. Magic which protects the integrity of a Lunar’s being or identity can do nothing to stop other Lunars from wearing her likeness; her contributions to the communal pool of this Charm draws from are irrevocable."
