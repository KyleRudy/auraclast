DragonBlooded,General Terrestrial,Excellence of the Five Dragons: (Ability) ,1,,,"By drawing upon the latent Essence of her aspect element, the Dragon-Blood may incredible feats.","Select one Ability when purchasing this Charm. At any time, the player may reflexively spend 1 Mote to add (that Ability rating) dice to all rolls using this Ability for (Essence rating + 1) rounds in combat, or minutes outside of combat.
This Charm can be repurchased to unlock additional Abilities, but Motes must be spent to add dice to each Ability separately. Only those versions of this Charm which correspond to an Exalt’s Aspect Abilities are eligible for an aspect affinity discount.

DragonBlooded,General Terrestrial,Dragon-Blessed Stride ,1,,"Athletics,Survival","The Dragon-Blooded attunes her elemental nature to an untamed landscape matching her aspect, and moves through it as though it were a clear roadway.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote to navigate a certain form of difficult terrain without being forced to employ complex movement.
• Air: The Exalt can move through deep snow and on slippery ice unimpeded.
• Earth: The Exalt can move through debris fields, steep mountainsides, and the uneven floor of caves unimpeded.
• Fire: The Exalt can cross shifting and treacherous sand slopes and dune faces unimpeded.
• Water: The Exalt can move through deep mud and waist-high water unimpeded.
• Wood: The Exalt can move through tangled thickets and choked undergrowth unimpeded.
This Charm lasts until the sun next rises or sets. It can be repurchased to obtain the effects of a non-native Aspect, but only one effect can be used at a time. Repurchases are not considered general Charms, and use the Resonance listed."
DragonBlooded,General Terrestrial,Dragon-Graced Assault ,1,,"Archery,Melee","The Dragon-Blooded imbues an attack with the surging power of elemental Essence. This is the source of fists wreathed in flame, arrows trailing lightning bolts, and blades studded with thorns.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote to enhance all attacks made during the next (1 + Essence rating) rounds. The effects of this Charm depend on the Exalt’s Aspect: • Air: The attack is surrounded by buffeting winds and crackling lightning. Add +3 to its base damage, and if the target suffers any damage after soak, they are knocked sprawling to the ground; they must climb back to their feet on their next turn, a form of complex movement that leaves them unable to move to another zone.
• Earth: The attack is studded with jagged protrusions of stone and crystal. Add +3 to its base damage, and the target is momentarily stunned; their next action suffers a –2 dice penalty.
• Fire: The attack is wreathed in flames. Add +4 to its base damage.
• Water: A concentrated edge of water cuts through defenses. Protagonists suffer a –3 dice penalty to their soak pool. Antagonists decrease their soak value by –1.
• Wood: The attack is covered in bristling thorns. Add +3 to its base damage. Anyone who suffers damage from the attack increases their wound penalties by one for the rest of the scene as a painful toxin burns through their body.
Dragon-Graced Assault can be repurchased to obtain the effects of a non-native Aspect, but only one effect can enhance any single attack. Repurchases are not considered general Charms, and use the Resonance listed."
DragonBlooded,General Terrestrial,Dragon-Marked Hooves ,1,,Ride,"Spurring her mount on to an all-out gallop, the Dragon-Blooded channels her Essence through it, leaving a dangerous hazard in her wake.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote while riding a mount all-out to transform the ground it crosses into a hazard. The exact manifestation depends on the character’s Aspect.
• Air: A massive blast of turbulent air trails in the Exalt’s wake, raising the difficulty to close in on her by +2.
• Earth: The mount’s hooves or feet chew up the ground, both pulverizing its surface and pulling up spikes of jagged stone from deep within the earth. Pursuers must succeed at a Perception + Awareness roll against difficulty 8 or else be violently dismounted or knocked down, with both rider and mount being forced to soak four levels of bashing damage. They must climb back to their feet on their next turn, a form of complex movement that leaves them unable to move to another zone.
• Fire: The ground catches fire in the Exalt’s wake, creating an environmental hazard that inflicts four level of lethal damage to anyone who fails a difficulty 7 Wits + (Athletics or Ride) roll to avoid it.
• Water: A slick of ice coats the ground where the Exalt passes, causing anyone trying to pursue her to subtract successes on results of both 1 and 2, and to suffer a botch if reduced to no successes by 1s and 2s.
• Wood: Grasping vines smash up through the ground and quickly choke its surface. Everyone trying to move through the mess suffers a –3 die penalty to do so.
This Charm lasts as long as the Exalt keeps her mount running all-out. It can be repurchased to obtain the effects of a non-native Aspect, but only one effect can be used at a time. Repurchases are not considered general Charms, and use the Resonance listed."
DragonBlooded,General Terrestrial,Elemental Bolt Attack ,1,,,"The Dragon-Blooded concentrates her Essence into a weapon, hurling a deadly elemental manifestation at her enemies. This manifestation varies based on her Aspect: Air Aspects hurl a lightning bolt; Earth Aspects, a jagged stone spike; Fire Aspects, a bolt of flame; Water Aspects, a lance of gleaming ice; and Wood Aspects, a wooden javelin.","The Exalt is always armed with a Dexterity + Thrown weapon which can target opponents up to one zone away, with a base damage of 6L. If she opts to spend 1 Mote when making an attack, this weapon’s base damage increases to 8L.
A group of Dragon-Blooded who know this Charm can coordinate their use of it through a single leader. If they all opt to hold their action until all of their opponents have acted, they can nominate a single one of their number as a leader. This individual makes an attack roll to use Elemental Bolt Attack, with its base damage boosted by +3L for each Exalt supporting her.
Anyone supporting the main attacker forfeits their turn to feed her power. Each participant who spends 1 Mote increases the base damage of the bolt by a further +2L."
DragonBlooded,General Terrestrial,Elemental Sheath ,1,,,"The Dragon-Blooded pushes a weapon or small object into a manifestation of her aspect element such as a large stone, a roaring fire, or a pool of water. Later, she may retrieve it from another such manifestation.","Sheathing an object in her aspect element costs only a turn spent in concentration.
Retrieving it later requires either another turn, or else the reflexive expenditure of 1 Mote."
DragonBlooded,General Terrestrial,(Element)-Protection Form ,2,,"Resistance,Survival","The Dragon-Blooded enfolds herself in her Aspect element, gaining protection from its hostile manifestations.","Spend 1 Mote to activate this Charm. For the rest of the scene, the Dragon-Blooded is immune to environmental damage from her Aspect element (such as storms, avalanches, wildfires, and the like), and lowers the difficulty to soak direct attacks using that element by –1.
This Charm may be re-purchased (in which case its Resonance comes into play) to gain protection from other elements as well, though each version of the Charm must be activated separately. (Metal, it should be noted, is not considered to fall under the direct protection of any element.) Fire Aspects do not treat this as a general Charm, and can skip directly to purchasing protection from other elements, since their anima power already provides comprehensive protection from fire."
DragonBlooded,General Terrestrial,Elemental Succor Method ,2,,,"By seeking refuge in her element, the Dragon-Blood may rapidly restore herself to health.","By resting while surrounded by a potent manifestation of her Aspect — strong winds or intense cold, bare soil, intense heat, immersing water, or growing things — the Dragon-Blood may heal bashing damage at a rate of one level every fifteen minutes, and lethal damage at a rate of one level per hour."
DragonBlooded,General Terrestrial,Elemental Empowerment Meditation ,3,,,"In extreme circumstances, the character may cannibalize her Aspect element for power, ripping the Essence out of the world and leaving it injured and barren.","Spend 1 Willpower and roll (Strength or Intelligence) + Occult (difficulty 7) in the presence of a significant manifestation of the character’s aspect element (strong winds, great stoneworks, roaring flames, etc). Each success restores one Mote, but also destroys or ruins the focus of this Charm: stone crumbles, the wind stills, water becomes stagnant, plants die, fires are extinguished. Additionally, natural disasters befall all spirit sanctums within a mile of the point where this Charm is used: they are lashed by powerful hurricane-force winds, shaken by earthquakes, scoured by wildfires, and so on, inflicting significant damage to the divine structures and belongings within. Habitual use of this Charm tends to enrage the little gods."
DragonBlooded,General Terrestrial,Fivefold Dragon Shout ,3,,"Presence,War","The Dragon-Blooded dredges up all the power of her Essence, and releases it as a mighty roar which bathes the battlefield in a wild and uncontrolled manifestation of elemental fury.","Spend 2 Motes and roll Charisma + (Presence or War) against difficulty 6. A blast of unleashed elemental power washes over everyone within one contiguous zone for each success rolled, starting with the zone the Dragon-Blooded occupies.
• Air: For Air Aspects, this is the Storm-Throated Thunder Shout. Everyone caught in the blast must soak 3 levels of bashing damage and is knocked prone; they must climb back to their feet on their next turn, a form of complex movement that leaves them unable to move to another zone.
• Earth: For Earth Aspects, this is the Earth-Shattering Dragon Roar. Everyone caught in its area of effect must soak 2 levels of bashing damage, suffers –1 die to all actions for the next two rounds, and is knocked prone; they must climb back to their feet on their next turn, a form of complex movement that leaves them unable to move to another zone.
• Fire: For Fire Aspects, this is the Incendiary Dragon Shout. Everyone caught in its area of effect must soak three automatic levels of lethal damage. The blast leaves particularly flammable objects still burning.
• Water: For Water Aspects, this is the All-Consuming Tsunami Shout. Everyone caught in its area of effect must soak one automatic level of bashing damage, and their lungs are also filled with water. They suffer a –3 dice drowning penalty on all actions until they successfully use a turn to make a Stamina + Resistance roll (difficulty 7) to vomit up a great quantity of water.
• Wood: For Wood Aspects, this is the Verdant Cry of the Wood Dragon. Everyone caught in its area of effect must soak two automatic levels of lethal damage, and the area is left covered in tangles of sudden plant growth that makes all movement undertaken within the affected area by anyone other than the Exalt herself into complex movement.
This Charm can be repurchased to obtain the effects of a non-native Aspect, but only one effect can be used at a time. Repurchases are not considered general Charms, and use the Resonance listed."
DragonBlooded,General Terrestrial,Unassailable Body of (Element) Defense ,3,,,"The Dragon-Blooded utterly surrenders herself to the purity of her aspect, achieving a moment of oneness in which she approaches invulnerability. She momentarily transforms into her aspect element — she becomes a figure made of mist, dust, smoky flame, water, or swirling leaves — allowing an attack to pass harmlessly through her.","Once per scene, spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower in response to an attack or other hazard.
The attack fails to strike the Exalt. This Charm cannot be used in response to undodgeable attacks. It also has a particular weakness, depending on the character’s aspect.
• Air: Air is vulnerable to earth-aspected attacks and against attacks made with two-handed close-range weapons, whose sheer bulk disrupts her form. The Charm fails to protect the Exalt against such attacks.
• Earth: Earth is vulnerable to wood-aspected attacks and against attacks made with wooden weapons such as arrows or clubs, as the earth habitually yields to burrowing roots. This Charm fails to protect the Exalt against such attacks.
• Fire: Fire is vulnerable to water-aspected attacks; this Charm fails to protect the Exalt against such attacks. It also cannot be activated while the Exalt is wet, such as when underwater, standing in the rain, or when she has just emerged from a bath.
• Water: Water is vulnerable to air-aspected attacks and attacks made with ice or with freezing cold. This Charm fails to protect the Exalt against such attacks. It also cannot be activated while the Exalt stands in freezing temperatures.
• Wood: Wood is vulnerable to fire-aspected attacks and to burning attacks such as flaming arrows. This Charm fails to protect the Exalt against such attacks."
DragonBlooded,Air,Drifting Zephyr Step ,1,,Athletics,"Essence lightens the Dragon-Blood’s step, allowing her to quickly disentangle herself from the fiercest fray by riding the shafts of arrows and treading upon the tips of spears.","(Half of her Essence rating, round up) times per battle, the Exalt may reflexively move to a different zone despite having been attacked before her turn."
DragonBlooded,Air,Elemental Concentration Trance ,1,,Lore,"An ever-popular Charm among diligent students of the Spiral Academy and the Heptagram, this technique permits the Dragon-Blooded to compact a week’s worth of learning into a single day of furious study, assuming she has all of the materials she’ll need to consult ready to hand.","The Exalt suffers one level of unavoidable bashing damage upon activating this Charm, and another level at the beginning of each subsequent day of using this Charm, which she cannot heal until her studying binge is complete."
DragonBlooded,Air,Gale-Force Research Technique ,1,,Lore,"While standing within a library or similar archive, the Dragon-Blooded fixes a question in her mind and unleashes her Essence. Violent winds disrupt the room, toppling books from shelves and scattering loose papers in all directions. If the information she seeks is present, then when she opens her eyes, she will find it sitting before her; the relevant papers have been blown into her hands, or the relevant book has tumbled open in front of her, opened to the passage she needs.
Exalts are encouraged not to use this Charm in the library of anyone they particularly care about keeping friendly toward them, since even if it doesn’t damage rare volumes or fragile relics, it always makes a hell of a mess.",The character spends 1 Mote and rolls Intelligence + Lore against difficulty 5. Success allows her to locate any relevant information instantly if it is there to be found.
DragonBlooded,Air,Grasping Talon of the Wind Dragon ,1,,"Athletics,Thrown","The Dragon-Blooded creates a powerful wind-vortex in her hand, drawing a nearby object into her grasp.","With a moment’s concentration, the Exalt’s player may roll Dexterity + Athletics against difficulty 6 to pull an object into the character’s hand. The object can weigh no more than 10 pounds (or must be an attuned artifact, which may ignore this weight limit), must be no more than one zone away, and cannot be held or carried by another character. Alternately, the DragonBlooded can reflexively spend 1 Mote to draw the item to hand without need of an action or a roll (but otherwise still subject to the above restrictions).
If a Dragon-Blooded knows this Charm, then any Thrown weapon she hurls always reflexively returns to her hand at the end of the round unless she wishes it not to."
DragonBlooded,Air,Harmonious Wind-Luring Song ,1,,"Linguistics,Occult,Performance","The Exalt composes a quick performance — a song, a musical number, a recited poem — as a gift to the elementals of the world. If they find it pleasing, the winds soon begin to blow according to her desire.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Charisma + (Linguistics or Performance) against difficulty 6.
The wind picks up and blows as the Exalt desires for a number of hours equal to the successes rolled. By default, this is a stiff, substantial wind: not violent or damaging, but enough to reduce the maximum range of Archery attacks launched directly against it by one zone, and to move a sailing vessel. If three successes are rolled, the Dragon-Blooded may instead opt to conjure a violent storm which runs out of her control for an hour, with successes beyond the three required to conjure it being used to extend its duration for additional hours. The storm isn’t at the level of a full-blown environmental hazard, but getting around in it requires complex movement, it imposes a –2 penalty to all Awareness rolls, and it will generally play havoc with shipping, troop movements, public gatherings, and the like."
DragonBlooded,Air,Language-Learning Ritual ,1,,"Linguistics,Lore","By spending at least an hour listening to a language, the Dragon-Blooded may gain temporary fluency in it.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Intelligence + Linguistics (difficulty 6) to capture a swirl of unfamiliar words within the familiar embrace of the wind. The character gains fluency in the targeted language for a number of days equal to the successes rolled. If no successes are rolled, gain fluency for one scene."
DragonBlooded,Air,Soundless Action Prana ,1,,Stealth,The Dragon-Blooded stirs the air to smother all noises she makes.,"Spend 1 Mote or 1 Willpower. For the rest of the scene, the character’s actions make no noise at all unless she wishes them to."
DragonBlooded,Air,Voice of Mastery ,1,,"Linguistics,Presence,War","The Dragon-Blooded may use her Essence to compress data into its most compact and efficacious presentation, conveying a wealth of meaning in only a few words: a useful talent indeed for a battlefield commander.","Spend 1 Mote. The Exalt may use only a single turn — in dramatic time, about five seconds — to completely and concisely sum up data that would normally require up to a halfhour of careful explanation, without losing any nuance at all."
DragonBlooded,Air,Whispering Thief Technique ,1,,"Larceny,Linguistics,Performance","The Dragon-Blooded may breathe her words into the wind, allowing her to throw her voice.","The character may, at any time, make her voice seem to issue from anywhere, anyone, or anything within the same or an adjacent zone without need for a dice roll."
DragonBlooded,Air,Wind-Carried Words Technique ,1,,Linguistics,"The Dragon-Blooded may entrust her words to the wind, letting it carry whatever she says to a desired recipient.","The character speaks a message no longer than a few sentences, then rolls Wits + Linguistics. The wind carries her words to a desired character up to (successes × 10) miles away.
If the target is the subject of one of her Intimacies, or if the Dragon-Blooded spends 1 Mote, they may be up to (successes × 100) miles away."
DragonBlooded,Air,Wind Weapons ,1,,"Melee,Thrown","With but a moment’s concentration, the Exalt may solidify melee or throwing weapons out of the very air itself.","Roll Wits + Athletics against difficulty 6 to sculpt a desired melee or throwing weapon from the air itself. Melee weapons last for the rest of the scene, while throwing weapons dissipate after being hurled, only to be immediately replaced by a fresh copy. Alternately, spend 1 Mote to reflexively begin wielding Wind Weapons without needing to spend a turn in concentration or make a roll."
DragonBlooded,Air,Crosswind Gale Offense ,2,,Melee,The Dragon-Blooded may conjure a powerful wind to carry even the heaviest of weapons into a distant enemy and then return it to her hand.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, the character can make Melee and Martial Arts attacks against enemies up to one range band away by throwing her weapon and then having it come back to her once the attack resolves."
DragonBlooded,Air,Distracting Breeze Meditation ,2,,"Occult,Thrown","The Dragon-Blooded may stir the wind to knock over small objects, slam doors, rustle curtains, and otherwise cause small distractions.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Dexterity + (Occult or Thrown). For the next (1 + successes rolled) scenes, all opposed rolls against the Dragon-Blooded (such as to detect her while she hides, or to attack her) suffer a –1 die penalty."
DragonBlooded,Air,Grace of Mela ,2,,"Athletics,Lore,Occult","The Dragon-Blooded may fill herself with the ferocity of the cyclone, the speed of the gale, or the grandeur of the raging storm simply by exposure to such forces of nature.","When exposed to a significant manifestation of the element of wind such as a powerful storm, or when at great elevation (atop a tower, high up on a mountain), the Dragon-Blooded adds one bonus die to all rolls based on Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, Perception, or Wits."
DragonBlooded,Air,Horizon-Spanning Arc ,2,,"Archery,Thrown",The Dragon-Blood uses a concentrated stream of wind to carry her attack much farther than it should possibly be able to reach.,The Exalt may launch an Archery or Thrown attack against a target one zone farther away than the normal maximum range of her weapon. This Charm may be used a number of times per scene equal to her Essence rating.
DragonBlooded,Air,Speech Without Words ,2,,"Linguistics,War","The Exalt may instinctively craft highly expressive hand signals, facial expressions, and nonverbal communicative ticks (such as winking, tapping a foot twice, clicking a spoon against her glass, or pulling an earlobe) in order to secretly convey info to those she is familiar with.","This Charm grants the Exalt a highly informal secret language that she can adapt to be understood by anyone she has been familiar with for more than a day. She can tune her semaphore at any time to be understood only by those she wishes to understand it. Observers can make a Perception + Awareness roll against a difficulty of (4 + Exalt’s Linguistics rating) to realize she’s using code-signs and not simply feeling restless, but the actual code itself is as difficult to decode as any language would be. If Charms are used to do so, they do not convey an enduring benefit; the Exalt essentially invents this language anew in each scene where she uses it."
DragonBlooded,Air,Spirit-Detecting Mirror Technique ,2,,"Awareness,Occult","The Exalt may attune her senses to the subtle presence of gods and ghosts, glimpsing them in reflective surfaces such as mirrors or still water.","Concentrate and roll Perception + Occult (difficulty 8) while staring into a reflective surface, or spend 1 Mote to bypass the roll. For the rest of the scene, the Exalt can see dematerialized beings and spirit sanctums reflected in that surface, and can physically interact with them. Targeting opponents in combat by such awkward means imposes a –2 die penalty."
DragonBlooded,Air,Voices on the Wind ,2,,Awareness,"The Exalt stirs the wind to bring words to her ears, allowing her to eavesdrop from afar.","The Exalt may devote her full concentration to stirring the air. While she does so, she can listen in on what is being said in a location up to (Awareness rating) zones away as though she stood in the midst of the speakers."
DragonBlooded,Air,Wind Armor Technique ,2,,"Craft,Occult,Resistance,War","The Dragon-Blooded, in a moment of ferocious concentration, solidifies the air around her into a suit of shimmering armor.","The Exalt must spend a turn in concentration and succeed at a difficulty 9 Wits + (Craft, Occult, or Resistance) roll in order to immediately create and don a suit of mundane medium armor which lasts for the rest of the scene. Alternately, she may reflexively pay 1 Mote to sculpt the armor without need for a roll or a turn of concentration. This armor has no fatigue value. It cannot be worn over the top of real armor."
DragonBlooded,Air,With One Mind ,2,,War,"The Dragon-Blood moves in perfect synchronicity with her comrades to seize the advantage in battle, carving an opening that they instinctively see the opportunity to support.","When an Exalt with this charm cuts ahead in battle, one of her allies may immediately follow her and do so as well before any of their opponents gets a chance to act, and does not have to pay Willpower to take advantage of the opening. This Charm can activate a number of times per battle equal to the user’s Essence rating."
DragonBlooded,Air,Dragon Shroud Technique ,3,,Stealth,"The Dragon-Blooded can wrap herself in a shroud of concealing air, becoming little more than a faint shimmer.","Spending 2 Motes renders the Exalt invisible and impossible to notice for the rest of the scene, so long as she doesn’t make some sort of loud noise or take blatant action such as attacking or tipping over a bookshelf."
DragonBlooded,Air,Elemental Concentration Trance ,3,,Lore,"By intently focusing her Essence, the Dragon-Blooded may compress many days of study into an hour.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Intelligence + Lore (difficulty 7). The player may add the character’s Essence rating in additional Ability dots to whatever subjects or activities the character studied. These dots remain for a number of days equal to the successes rolled, and cannot raise an Ability above 5 dots. Only one instance of this Charm may be active at a time."
DragonBlooded,Air,Elusive Cyclone Defense ,3,,Athletics,"The Dragon-Blooded girds herself in a powerful barrier of howling winds, brushing aside incoming projectiles.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the next (2 + Essence rating) turns, subtract one success from all ranged attacks directed against the Exalt."
DragonBlooded,Air,Haunting Words Infliction ,3,,Presence,"The Dragon-Blooded’s words wind their way deep into the soul of another, striking through her cynicism and practical concerns to find her heart.","Spend 1 Mote when making an inspiration attempt (see p. XX) to lower its difficulty by –2. If the character is trying to instill one of her own Intimacies into the target, lower the difficulty by –3 instead."
DragonBlooded,Air,Seeking Missile Technique ,3,,"Archery,Thrown","The Exalt bends the winds around the course of her attacks, granting even those arrows and knives that disappoint her at first an ultimate second chance to do their work.","When an Archery or Thrown attack on which the Exalt spent a point of Willpower to lower the difficulty nonetheless fails to strike its target, then at the end of the round after all other characters have acted, she may roll the attack and apply it again as the wind carries her projectile back around for another try. This Charm may activate a number of times per scene equal to the character’s Essence rating."
DragonBlooded,Air,Terrestrial Circle Sorcery ,3,,Occult,The Dragon-Blooded has been initiated into the practice of sorcery. She can cast Terrestrial Circle spells and enact sorcerous workings. Purchase of this Charm grants one shaping ritual and one Terrestrial Circle spell.,See Chapter Eleven for rules on playing a sorcerer.
DragonBlooded,Air,Vengeful Gust Strike ,3,,"Archery,Brawl,Martial Arts","The Dragon-Blooded learns to harness the gale as her weapon, sending foes flying.","When the Exalt launches an attack, she may reflexively spend 1 Mote before rolling to wreath her attack in a latent stormburst. If the attack succeeds, it increases its base damage by +2, sends her opponent flying into an adjacent zone and knocks them prone; they must climb back to their feet on their next turn, a form of complex movement that leaves them unable to move to another zone. Additionally, any 10s on the damage roll count as two successes, as the Dragon-Blooded fortuitously aims her enemy at something hard or dangerous."
DragonBlooded,Air,Whirlwind Shield Form ,3,,"Athletics,Resistance,Stealth","The Dragon-Blooded bends ferocious air currents around herself, creating a defensive barrier against ranged attacks.","Spend 1 Mote reflexively. For the rest of the scene, the character adds her Dexterity in additional soak dice against damage from ranged attacks."
DragonBlooded,Earth,All-Encompassing Earth Sense ,1,,Awareness,"By concentrating for a moment, the Dragon-Blooded extends her senses down into the earth itself, “seeing” the weight and tremors of movement upon the ground.","The character can “see” perfectly in the dark, so long as what she’s “seeing” is connected to the ground in any way. This Charm cannot see any flying creature or object, and is entirely useless in or upon deep water or in the air."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Crystal Sight Focus ,1,,Awareness,"Sharpening her vision by focusing her Essence like a prism, the Dragon-Blood gains unsurpassed clarity of sight.","The Exalt must spend a turn in concentration to activate or banish this Charm. While it is active, the difficulty of all vision-based Perception rolls drops by –3, to a minimum of difficulty 3. This level of constant visual overstimulation is difficult to manage, and so the character suffers a cumulative –1 die penalty to all rolls involving her mental Attributes for each consecutive scene after the first where she has this Charm active most of the time."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Earth Dragon’s Stony Glare ,1,,Presence,"The character makes her eyes hard and unforgiving as flint, even as her features subtly sharpen.",All intimidation attempts are made at –1 difficulty.
DragonBlooded,Earth,Entombed Mind Technique ,1,,Empathy,"The Dragon-Blooded may carefully infuse the somnolent Essence of Earth into someone, placing them into a deep slumber.","By force, guile, social obligation or trickery, the Dragon-Blooded must arrange for her target to remain relatively still for five minutes in order to use this Charm. She may then spend 1 Mote and her player rolls Stamina + Empathy, contested by the target’s Willpower (both at difficulty 6). The target falls asleep for one hour per success by which the Dragon-Blooded wins the contest, and cannot be roused by anything shy of a cacophonous sound or being physically shaken or injured."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Inviolable Diamond Soul ,1,,Resistance,"The Dragon-Blooded hardens her spirit against the corrosive influence of the Wyld, turning the flows of her Essence inward to survive extended forays into the lands of madness. This inversion slowly poisons her, and so is not an indefinite defense, merely an extended one.","It takes only a turn of concentration to activate this Charm. The character is protected against the mutating and maddening influence of the Wyld while it is active. At the end of every full 24 hours in which this Charm is left active, the character suffers one level of unavoidable aggravated damage as her body slowly turns into living stone or crystal. This damage cannot be healed by any means while the Charm remains active. If she permits Inviolable Diamond Soul to kill her, she leaves behind a stone or crystalline statue brimming with potent Essence and potentially useful in artifact-crafting.
The character may spend 1 Mote to extend this Charm’s benefits to up to (Essence rating) companions when she activates it, but she suffers an additional level of damage for each person she protects when the Charm’s bill comes due each day unless she also knows Chaos-Warding Prana. If she knows both Charms, then she merely needs to pay a 1 Mote upkeep every 24 hours to continue to extend its benefits while suffering only a single level of daily damage."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Mountain-Trampling Hoof ,1,,Ride,"The Dragon-Blood sheathes herself and her mount in a temporary shell of powerful Essence, protecting them both and allowing them to break through all opposition.","While mounted, spend 1 Mote and roll Stamina + Ride against difficulty 8. Success adds (Ride rating) additional soak to both the Exalt and her mount until her next turn, and allows her to move from one zone to an adjacent zone regardless of obstacles up to and including solid stone walls: she simply crashes through in a cloud of dust and debris, unharmed."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Ox-Body Technique ,1,,Resistance,"The Terrestrial’s body is fortified with the solidity of the earth, enabling her to survive grievous injuries.","The character permanently gains an additional set of (–0) and (–1) health levels.
This Charm can be purchased a number of times equal to the higher of the character’s Stamina or Resistance ratings."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Righteous Lion Defense ,1,,"Presence,Resistance","The Dragon-Blooded fortifies her beliefs with the solidity of the Earth itself, encasing her convictions in the heart of an unassailable mountain.","Any attempt to cause or force the Exalt to betray, undermine, or abandon her Intimacies automatically fails."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Shaping Hand Style ,1,,Craft,"The Exalt may use her bare hands as though they were a variety of mundane tools without suffering any damage, hammering in nails with her fists or pulling them out with her teeth, sawing boards with a knife-edge hand motion, and so on.",The Exalt never suffers any penalties or problems from lacking the proper tools to construct or repair something.
DragonBlooded,Earth,Stone-Carving Fingers Form ,1,,Craft,"Taking a moment to concentrate her Essence into her fingertips, the Exalt gains the ability to work stone with her bare hands as though it were soft clay.","Roll Willpower (difficulty 6) to activate this Charm for a scene. While this Charm has obvious utility in sculpture, it can also be used to dig through or easily climb up stone surfaces."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Chaos-Warding Prana ,2,,"Occult,Resistance",The Dragon-Blooded solidifies her Essence to resist hostile magic and the powers of chaos.,"Whenever the character is the subject of any hostile supernatural power that seeks to transform, infect, taint, transport, or control her body or spirit, or to warp her destiny or place in the world (such as by attacking her Backgrounds), the difficulty to do so is raised by 1. If affected anyway, she may spend 1 Mote and roll Stamina + Occult against difficulty 8. Success shatters the magic, protecting the Dragon-Blooded completely. Since this expenditure isn’t reflexive, the Dragon-Blooded may spend a few moments fluctuating in mid-transformation or teleportation, as her Essence battles with the magic seeking to suborn her."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Flawless Diamond Heart ,2,,"Empathy,Presence,Resistance","The Exalt’s resolve has about it the solidity of stone, its roots sunk as deep into her spirit as the Imperial Mountain which anchors all of Creation.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, Willpower rolls are not subject to the rule of 1s, and count results of 10 as two successes."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Granite Curtain of Serenity ,2,,"Empathy,Resistance","Entombing her mind in a crystalline shell of Essence, the Dragon-Blooded protects herself from attempts to subvert her thoughts and feelings.",Reflexively spend 1 Mote to become immune to all thought and emotion-altering magic for a number of minutes equal to the character’s Essence rating.
DragonBlooded,Earth,Heart-Crushing Stone ,2,,"Empathy,Resistance","The Exalt may, when her own values are being turned against her, crush them between the stones of her resolve and her Essence in order to escape their influence.",The Exalt may pay 1 Mote to destroy one of her permanent or temporary Intimacies. It cannot be rebuilt until (Essence rating) stories have ended.
DragonBlooded,Earth,Impervious Skin of Stone Meditation ,2,,Resistance,"The Dragon-Blooded draws the solidity of stone up into her flesh. She must be in contact with stone or soil to use this Charm. Traditionally this is accomplished by standing upon the bare Earth or a stone floor, but many Dragon-Blooded carry a small rock in their pocket, or wear a precious stone on a ring in order to use this Charm at any time.",Reflexively spending 1 Mote allows the Dragon-Blooded to change her soak pool calculation to (Stamina + Resistance + armor’s Soak value) for the rest of the scene.
DragonBlooded,Earth,Pasiap Still Stands ,2,,"Awareness,Athletics,Presence,Resistance",The Dragon-Blooded may fill herself with the unyielding solidity of the Earth itself simply by being enfolded in its mass.,"When surrounded by earth and stone, such as within a cave or canyon, within a structure primarily made of earth and stone, or when underground (in a basement, sewer system, etc), the Dragon-Blooded adds one bonus die to all rolls based on Strength, Stamina, Charisma, Perception, or Intelligence."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Sense-Destroying Technique ,2,,"Awareness,Occult","Through a moment’s total concentration and a precision application of offensive Essence, the Dragon-Blooded may shut down someone else’s senses, striking them blind, deaf, or bereft of taste and smell.","Concentrate utterly upon a target no more than one zone away and roll Intelligence + Awareness, contested by the target’s Willpower, both at difficulty 6. If the Exalt beats the target’s successes, he loses access to a sense of her choosing until the end of the current round: sight, smell and taste, or hearing and touch. If she beats the target by a number of successes equal to his Perception rating, or opts to reflexively spend 1 Mote after beating his Willpower roll by a lesser number of successes, then she may shut down that sense until the end of the current scene. See page XX for rules on fighting while blind."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Strength of Stone Technique ,2,,Athletics,"The Dragon-Blooded draws power from the Earth itself into her body. She must be in contact with stone or soil to use this Charm. Traditionally this is accomplished by standing upon the bare Earth or a stone floor, but many Dragon-Blooded carry a small rock in their pocket, or wear a precious stone on a ring in order to use this Charm at any time.",The difficulty of feats of strength to lift or break something while in contact with stone or soil are lowered by –2. The Dragon-Blooded may reflexively spend 1 Mote to cause her unarmed attacks to gain a base damage of 7B for the rest of the scene while she is in contact with stone or soil.
DragonBlooded,Earth,Touch of Unmaking ,2,,Craft,Everything that has ever been made has its origin in the Earth’s bounty. The Dragon-Blood may return those creations to their mother’s bosom.,"Spend 1 Mote and touch an object up to the size of a wagon, then roll Strength + Crafts against a difficulty based on the object’s complexity (basically, the difficulty should match the difficulty of a roll to craft the object). Success renders the object back down into its component elements: a wagon becomes a pile of disassembled lumber and steel, while a sword would be reduced to raw iron. This Charm isn’t sufficient to destroy artifacts."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Earth’s Judgment Awakened ,3,,"Archery,Empathy,Martial Arts,Melee","The Dragon-Blooded polishes her Essence into a mirror which reflects her foes’ inadequacies of spirit. When next she strikes, it is against her enemies’ convictions, not their skill.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the round, all attacks the Exalt launches are made against a difficulty of her target’s Willpower (or Resolve) rather than his Defense."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Five Dragons Fight as One ,3,,War,"Drawing upon the greatness of her spirit, the Dragon-Blooded lends out her power and surety to her allies in a time of crisis.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Charisma + War against difficulty 7. The Dragon-Blooded may divide a pool of her Essence rating or successes rolled (whichever is lower) dice between allies in her immediate presence at the beginning of each turn of combat for the rest of the scene.

A character can only receive dice from a single Dragon-Blooded in any given turn."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Magma Hell Upheaval ,3,,"Athletics,Brawl","The Dragon-Blooded strikes or stamps the bare earth, drawing up the molten blood of Creation to scatter her foes.","Spend 1 Mote and spend an action striking the ground. Select a zone no more than two zones away from the Exalt. On her next turn, molten lava comes gushing up from the ground in the center of that zone, splashing about and spreading to cover it. Everyone in that zone must make a Wits + Athletics roll against difficulty 9 at the beginning of every turn they spend there.
Failure means they must soak five levels of lethal damage."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Perfected Scales of the Dragon ,3,,Resistance,"The Dragon-Blooded may summon the power of the earth into her body, fortifying herself with borrowed vitality. Her anima becomes an invisible shell over her skin, absorbing a modicum of damage on her behalf.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. The character gains a number of temporary (–0) health levels equal to her Essence rating for the rest of the scene. These are the first levels affected when she takes damage, and they are utterly destroyed rather than simply being marked with damage. This Charm can only be activated once per scene."

DragonBlooded,Earth,Sense-Riding Method ,3,,"Awareness,Empathy","Through total concentration, the Dragon-Blooded may insinuate her senses into the mind of another, “riding” their perceptions to see and hear whatever they do.","Spend 1 Mote to target a creature the Dragon-Blooded can see for sense-riding, then roll Perception + Awareness against a difficulty of their Willpower. The Exalt can ride her target’s senses for one hour per success gained, but her own body falls into a comatose state while doing so, and she can only be roused prematurely by voluntarily abandoning the Charm or by taking damage."
DragonBlooded,Earth,Unfeeling Earth Meditation ,3,,Resistance,"With a moment’s intense concentration, the Dragon-Blooded may become as enduring as the Earth itself.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Willpower (difficulty 6). For each success, the Dragon-Blooded may enjoy one of the following benefits for the rest of the scene: • She no longer experiences penalties for fatigue and exhaustion, and indeed needs neither rest nor sleep.
• She no longer experiences penalties for starvation or dehydration, and indeed has no need to eat or drink.
• She no longer needs to breathe.
• She does not age.
Alternately, the character may activate this Charm while quietly meditating, and may extend the Charm’s benefits for as long as she continues to do so."

DragonBlooded,Earth,Virtuous Mountain’s Shadow ,3,,"Presence,Socialize","When the Dragon-Blooded sees matters within a social milieu going somewhere that offends her sensibilities, she may smoothly intervene to put a stop to it, expressing either her personal convictions or the rules of propriety to do so.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote in response to another character’s social influence action.
Roll Charisma + (Presence or Socialize) against difficulty 7, or difficulty 5 if this intervention supports one of the character’s Intimacies. Each success rolled negates one of the original speaker’s successes."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Blinding Spark Distraction ,1,,"Archery,Melee,Thrown","When errant blades or arrows strike against the world, they do so in a great welter of stinging sparks.","When the Dragon-Blooded fails to strike her target with an attack made with a stone or metal weapon of any kind, the impact sends up a great eruption of sparks which cascade over her target, causing any actions he takes on his next turn to suffer a –3 dice pool penalty. This Charm doesn’t activate if an attack botches."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Confounding Escape ,1,,"Athletics,Ride,Stealth","Flooding her Essence into the ground in a flash of heat, the Dragon-Blooded produces a great cloud of smoke to cover her escape or advance.","Spend 1 Mote, then roll Dexterity + (Athletics or Ride, as appropriate) against difficulty 8 and move into an adjacent zone. Success blankets the Dragon-Blooded and her surroundings in a dense cloud of smoke that is impossible to see through for more than a foot or so, and which grows within mere moments to encompass a number of contiguous zones equal to the successes rolled, starting with the zone she was in when she activated this Charm. Swirls and eddies in the smoke allow the Dragon-Blooded to see through it with no difficulty. The smoke dissipates after a number of turns equal to (1 + the character’s Essence rating). For rules on fighting while blind, see p. XX."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Effortlessly Rising Flame ,1,,Athletics,The Exalt may propel herself upward with a controlled explosion beneath her.,"By reflexively spending 1 Mote, the Dragon-Blooded may increase her jumping distance or height threefold, lowering the difficulty of any attempt to jump a gap by –3.

DragonBlooded,Fire,Ghost-Fire Arsenal ,1,,"Archery,Melee",The Dragon-Blooded sculpts weaponry out of elemental flames.,"By taking an action and spending 1 Mote, the Dragon-Blooded can forge almost any mundane weapon she desires out of elemental flame, which persists for the rest of the scene. If anyone else tries to pick it up, they must soak 1 automatic level of lethal damage every turn they hold onto the weapon. Created weapons may be anything from a burning sword to a bow and flaming arrows; only firewands and other incendiary weapons are off-limits; even in phantasmal form, firedust is too unstable for this Charm. Ammunition for created ranged weapons may be drawn from another source of fire (a Fire Aspect’s own anima flare will do)."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Glowing Coal Radiance ,1,,"Presence,War","The Exalt briefly feeds Essence into her anima, brightening it into an eye-watering display of white-hot radiance.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. Until the end of the current round, the Exalt’s anima flux (if manifest) inflicts one additional level of damage to anyone who strikes the Dragon-Blooded (and is intense enough to affect supernatural opponents regardless of the Exalt’s Aspect), and anyone who wishes to attack her must first succeed at a reflexive Stamina + Awareness roll against difficulty 9 or else reel away, blinded by her radiance. They do not lose their turn, but must take some action other than to attack the Exalt instead."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Incense Smoke Ladder ,1,,Athletics,"The Exalt may run across walls or even ceilings, leaving behind glowing footprints seared into the surfaces she traverses.","The Exalt may run up vertical surfaces or even across ceilings by sprinting all-out. As soon as she stops moving, gravity reasserts itself as normal. This may allow her to reach normally inaccessible zones without using complex movement."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Loquacious Courtier Technique ,1,,Presence,"The Exalt’s passion becomes contagious, spilling out of her words to fill the hearts of those around her.","Whenever the Dragon-Blooded speaks in support of one of her Intimacies, reduce the difficulty by –2."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Moth to the Candle ,1,,Presence,The Dragon-Blooded stokes her Essence into an irresistible flame which blinds an enemy to all other threats.,"Select a target, then roll Charisma + Presence against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower.

DragonBlooded,Fire,Smoke Ascends to Heaven ,1,,"Occult,Performance","The Dragon-Blooded may make of her Essence a gift to the divine, offering it up as a sacrifice when she composes a prayer to one of the little gods.","Spend as many Motes as desired and roll Charisma + Performance against difficulty 8 (or difficulty 7 if the character takes at least an hour to perform elaborate prayers and commit her petition to writing upon fine silk before burning it) to direct a prayer to a particular god. The expenditure of Essence acts as a sacrificial offering with a Resources value equal to the Motes expended. If this expenditure at least matches the god’s Essence rating, they are highly likely to take particular notice of the prayer and it favorably."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Tireless Footfalls Technique ,1,,"Performance,War","So long as the Exalt encourages those she leads or accompanies with rousing songs, ribald tales, or other forms of performance to lift their hearts and fortify their spirits, they may march without cease, inured to the need for sleep or rest.","So long as the Dragon-Blooded maintains a steady stream of uplifting song, music, or stories, she and a group of companions of a Size up to (lower of her Essence or War rating, or higher of the two if she spends 2 Motes when beginning her performance) may march without rest or sleep. Every six hours, the Dragon-Blooded must make a Stamina + Resistance roll to keep marching and performing without flagging. This roll begins at difficulty 6, and increases by +1 on each subsequent interval. Once she finally fails, she cannot reactivate this Charm or benefit from its use by another character until she has slept."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Warm-Faced Seduction Style ,1,,"Presence,Socialize","The Exalt fills herself with the hot Essence of passion, stirring the appetites of those she interacts with.","Spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, all Appearance rolls are made at –1 difficulty, and all rolls to inspire lust or to seduce another character are made at –2 difficulty."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Auspicious First Meeting Attitude ,2,,"Presence,Socialize","The Exalt gives the impression of a warm face and friendly attitude to all those she meets, regardless of her actual expression or mood. She easily makes friends wherever she goes.","During the scene when someone first meets the Exalt, they’re favorably inclined toward her, and all her social actions against them are rolled at –2 difficulty."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Bellows-Pumping Stride ,2,,Athletics,"The Dragon-Blooded runs, and her footfalls strike flames from the earth, leaving a trail of fire in her wake.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, the difficulty of all actions to run someone down or get somewhere quickly are lowered by two. When she moves to an adjacent zone, the Dragon-Blooded may move two zones instead, leaving a trail of flames in her wake.
Anyone who tries to follow her into that zone before the end of the next round must make a successful difficulty 8 Dexterity + Athletics roll or soak three levels of lethal damage. She cannot use this burning two-zone movement option again if she did so on her previous turn."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Flickering Candle Meditation ,2,,"Athletics,Melee","Giving herself over to absolute defense, the Dragon-Blooded sways and flickers like a candle before the wind, aggressively untouchable.","So long as the Dragon-Blooded has not cut ahead at any point during the current battle, she increases her Defense rating by +1. If this would raise her Defense above 9, then attackers instead subtract one success from their attacks against her."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Hesiesh’s Tempered Heart ,2,,"Athletics,Presence,Socialize",The Dragon-Blooded may fill herself with the simmering heat of banked coals and the power of the raging inferno when she is surrounded by heat and flames.,"When engulfed in oppressive heat or flames, such as in sauna or burning building, the Dragon-Blooded adds one bonus die to all rolls based on Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, Appearance, or Wits."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Hopping Firecracker Evasion ,2,,Athletics,"The Dragon-Blooded twists the Essence of her enemy’s killing intent into explosive flames, hurling herself across the battlefield to avoid rapid sequences of attacks.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, once per round the DragonBlooded may reflexively move to an adjacent zone after an attack fails to strike her. She can use this to get away from a rapid flurry of extra action attacks, or disentangle herself from a pile of enemies."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Passion-Transmuting Nuance ,2,,"Empathy,Presence","Blowing on the heart of another, the Dragon-Blooded fills their soul with smoke and flame, confusing their passions and manipulating them into whatever form she desires.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Manipulation + Empathy against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower. This Charm governs the emotions of joy, rage, and terror. If the target is experiencing any of the three, and the Dragon-Blooded’s roll succeeds, she may transform that emotion into one of the other two at an equal degree of intensity. Protagonists may spend 2 Willpower to shut out this transmutation, while antagonists may lower their Resolve by –2 for the rest of the story."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Spirit-Searing Proposition ,2,,Presence,"The Dragon-Blooded’s impassioned entreaties strike deep into the hearts of those she petitions.
Those who deny her feel a part of their convictions rendered unto smoke and ash.","When another protagonist cites an Intimacy to refuse the character’s persuasion attempts, she may reflexively pay 1 Mote. The character refusing her persuasion must either pay one additional point of Willpower or else doubt the cited Intimacy for the rest of the current story.
When an antagonist cites an Intimacy to refuse the character’s persuasion attempt, she may reflexively pay 1 Mote to lower the antagonist’s Resolve by two for the rest of the current story."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Thoughts as Ashes Defense ,2,,"Empathy,Presence,Resistance","The Dragon-Blooded stokes the fire of her true passions, and burns away any externally-imposed thoughts or feelings.",Reflexively spend 1 Mote to utterly reject all thought and emotion-altering magic from a specific character or source for the rest of the scene.
DragonBlooded,Fire,Threshing Floor Technique ,2,,"Archery,Melee,War","The Exalt sets up a battle rhythm for her allies to follow, singling out a target and leading the assault against him.","Upon successfully attacking a target, reflexively spend 1 Mote. Each time another character attacks that same target before the end of the current round, they increase the base damage of their attack by +2."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Bonfire Shadow Evasion ,3,,Athletics,"The Dragon-Blooded vanishes into the churning shadows of her own anima. Her opponents strike at her, only to discover they have targeted a coil of smoke or a wavering phantom rather than the Exalt herself.","While the character’s anima is flaring, the first attack against her in each round is forced to discard one success."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Brother-Against-Brother Insinuation ,3,,Socialize,"Using only a few cutting words or an off-handed remark, the Exalt burns the bonds of camaraderie, friendship, love, and brotherhood that bind two characters together.","The Exalt selects two other characters as the target of this Charm and makes some small comment intended to provoke strife between them, such as “What did you say about him?”, “I hear he has some plans that don’t involve you,” or “It’s a shame how that business back in Nexus worked out,” and then spends 1 Mote. Each must succeed at a difficulty 9 Willpower roll or any positive Intimacy they have toward the other is cast into doubt for a number of scenes equal to the Dragon-Blooded’s Essence rating."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Comet-Deflecting Defense ,3,,"Martial Arts,Melee","The Dragon-Blooded moves into a perfected moment, flaring the inner spark of her Essence into a momentary, invincible conflagration. In its wake, she is briefly left as little more than exhausted ashes, but at least she still endures.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower to perfectly parry an attack of which the Exalt is aware, so long as it is directed at herself or someone else within the same zone. This Charm is so taxing that the character loses her next turn. She can only use Comet-Deflecting Defense once per scene."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Passion-Attuning Attitude ,3,,Empathy,"Closing her eyes for a moment and shutting out the rest of the world, the Dragon-Blooded becomes attuned to a certain passion in those around her: lust, anger, or fear. When she opens her eyes, those in the grip of the attuned passion seem to burn with an aura of pale flames only the Exalt can see.","Spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, those experiencing the attuned passion stand out like beacons to the Exalt’s senses."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Ringing Anvil Onslaught ,3,,"Brawl,Martial Arts,Melee","The Dragon-Blooded’s attacks strike, one after another, like a smith’s hammer shaping white-hot steel.","Reflexively spend 2 Motes upon attacking a target but failing to defeat them. The Dragon-Blooded may take a second turn after all other characters have acted, using it to launch a second attack at that target. This Charm costs only 1 Mote if used against a battle group that someone else has already attacked during the current round."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Safety Among Enemies ,3,,Athletics,"The Dragon-Blooded dodges through the midst of her enemies, confusing them with the bright gleam of her eyes and contrails of smoke that trail in her wake. Before they know what has happened, they lay dead, cut down by their own crossfire.",Reflexively spend 1 Mote after an attack fails to strike the character to redirect that attack at a different character within the same zone as the Dragon-Blooded. The attack is then rerolled and applied to its new target.
DragonBlooded,Fire,Smoothing Over the Past Technique ,3,,"Empathy,Socialize","Focusing her Essence through a warm smile and a few quick words, the Dragon-Blooded suppresses her target’s memories of past unpleasantness.","Spend 1 Motes and roll Manipulation + Socialize, resisted by the target’s Willpower (both at difficulty 6). For each success by which the Dragon-Blooded exceeds her target, she can make him temporarily forget about one scene or major event from their shared history together, such as the time he caught her sleeping with his wife or the time she cheated him out of a month’s wages at the card table. The target recovers his suppressed memories at the end of the scene, making repeated use of this Charm against the same target increasingly difficult as it becomes necessary to also suppress memories of previously using the Charm against him."
DragonBlooded,Fire,Virtuous Negation Defense ,3,,"Athletics,Martial Arts,Melee,War","Surrounding one of her allies like a warding pall of smoke, the Dragon-Blooded deflects and draws away attacks directed against him.",Reflexively spend 1 Mote to apply a protect action to a comrade in the same zone. This protection continues until one of the characters moves to a different zone.
DragonBlooded,Water,Confluence of Savant Thought ,1,,Bureaucracy,"When the Dragon-Blooded stands amidst the complex workings of a formal organization, knowledge of its structural workings trickle down to inform her smooth interactions with it.","When the Exalt engages with bureaucratic systems such as courts of law, templecomplexes, or government offices, red tape parts before her like the Red Sea and she is able to proceed in a mere fraction of the normal time."
DragonBlooded,Water,Crane Takes the Frog ,1,,Larceny,The Dragon-Blooded may plunge her hand through a solid surface such as the door of a safe or the lid of a chest and draw out an object from within.,"Spend 1 Mote to reach through a solid object. This Charm only allows a few moments to reach and grasp, and doesn’t provide time for carefully rummaging around, before it forcibly pushes the character’s hand back out. It can be used for a quick stab with a weapon through a thin wall. This Charm does nothing to help the Exalt see through the surface she’s reaching through, and so is best used in conjunction with Window-in-the-Door Technique."
DragonBlooded,Water,Homeward Trail Discovery Method ,1,,"Awareness,Investigation,Survival","Everyone is carried downstream from their home, and the Dragon-Blooded may follow that stream back to its source.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Perception + Investigation against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower. Success allows the Dragon-Blooded to depart immediately and follow her instincts unerringly back to the building or structure that the target considers their primary home. This Charm is no more accurate than locating a building — it won’t lead to a specific apartment, for example."
DragonBlooded,Water,Naked Thief Style ,1,,Larceny,"The rise and fall of tumblers within a lock is not, in its way, so unlike the motions of ocean waves. The Dragon-Blooded may pick locks and otherwise defeat security measures without any specialized or even improvised tools.","The character suffers no penalties for lacking proper tools for lockpicking, safecracking, jimmying windows, and the like, nor is any such action flatly impossible for lack of necessary tools."
DragonBlooded,Water,Observer Awareness Method ,1,,Awareness,No one can gaze upon water without the water capturing their likeness in turn. The DragonBlooded becomes keenly aware when she is being watched.,The difficulty to determine if the character is under observation is always lowered by – 2.
DragonBlooded,Water,Perfect Gambling Prana ,1,,Larceny,"With a tilt of her hand and a small burst of Essence, the Dragon-Blooded may alter the flow of probability so that it takes the course she desires.","Spend 1 Mote while observing something governed entirely by chance: the dealing of cards, the fall of dice, a raffle drawing. What should be up to sheer randomness instead generates the outcome the Dragon-Blooded desires."
DragonBlooded,Water,Precise Ink Technique ,1,,"Craft,Larceny,Linguistics","The Exalt is a master of forgery, perfectly able to duplicate someone else’s handwriting, signature, or even painting style. She may also quickly and flawlessly copy or transcribe any letter, document, or piece of art she has to hand as a reference.","The Exalt lowers the difficulty of all attempts to forge a handwriting style, signature, seal, or art style she has seen before by –4. If she has a reference copy to hand, she can always create a perfect duplicate which can only be uncovered as a forgery when subjected to supernatural scrutiny (and even then, the difficulty is 9). She can also transcribe text or copy images in a third the time it would usually take, if she spends 1 Mote."
DragonBlooded,Water,Ten Thousand Eyes of Heaven ,1,,"Awareness,Investigation","The Exalt extends her awareness into the water around her, gaining knowledge of the presence and exact position of anyone moving through it.","The Exalt is automatically aware of the presence and location of anyone within two zones so long as they are moving through water. If the Exalt is not actually swimming, the most common situation this Charm can be used in is “while it’s raining,” but it can also be used cleverly to spot characters who step into puddles or similar obstacles. Ten Thousand Eyes of Heaven detects invisible characters, but won’t defeat magic which forces the Exalt to fail to notice intruders."
DragonBlooded,Water,Water-Walking Technique ,1,,"Athletics,Sail,Survival","Calling upon her blood’s affinity for water, the Dragon-Blooded becomes the master of surface tension, able to walk upon the surface of the waves without sinking.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. The Exalt may stand, walk, or run upon water for the rest of the scene. In the case of particularly violent, churning waters, doing so may count as complex movement."
DragonBlooded,Water,Wave-Breaking Palm ,1,,"Brawl,Martial Arts","Imbuing her bare hands with the surging power of the tides, the Exalt becomes adept at blocking strikes.","By reflexively spending 1 Mote, the Exalt raises her Parry rating by +2 for the rest of the scene. If this would increase her Defense past 9, then any attack she attempts to Parry suffers a –2 penalty to its roll."
DragonBlooded,Water,Window-in-the-Door Technique ,1,,"Awareness,Larceny","The Dragon-Blooded passes her hand over a wall, and a small portion of it briefly becomes as transparent to her as a calm stream.",The Dragon-Blooded can see through a small section of enchanted wall for so long as she concentrates completely upon it.
DragonBlooded,Water,Drowning Embrace ,2,,"Brawl,Martial Arts","The Dragon-Blooded impregnates an attack with the invasive Essence of water, allowing her to drown her enemies on dry land.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote to enchant an attack with this Charm. If it deals any damage, then the target’s lungs fill with water. They suffer a –3 dice drowning penalty on all actions until they successfully take an action to make a Stamina + Resistance roll (difficulty 9) to vomit up a great quantity of water. Characters asphyxiate if they cannot do so within (their Stamina x 2) turns.
If the Dragon-Blooded successfully strikes a drowning target before they have taken their turn, she paralyzes their lungs for a moment and they cannot attempt to expel the water from their lungs that round."
DragonBlooded,Water,Fluid Recollection Insinuation ,2,,"Empathy,Presence","The Dragon-Blooded shines forth a false memory which is briefly reflected upon the surface of a stranger’s mind, convincing him ever-so-briefly that they know one another.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Manipulation + Presence against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower. If successful, the target gains a false recollection of having met the Dragon-Blooded before, in a situation and context she dictates upon activating this Charm. Fluid Recollection Insinuation builds a false Intimacy that lasts for a number of hours equal to the successes rolled to activate it, at which point the false memories become unreal and impossible to recall, and any commitments made while under their influence no longer feel real or binding (though they certainly still are if sanctified by magic like the Eclipse Caste oath power)."
DragonBlooded,Water,Fog Conjuration Prana ,2,,"Sail,Stealth","The Dragon-Blooded spends a few moments concentrating her Essence into her lungs, then breathes out a thick, obscuring fog.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Stamina + (Stealth or Sail) against difficulty 5. If used on land, the fog encompasses a number of contiguous zones equal to the successes rolled, raising the difficulty of all Awareness rolls made by anyone other than the Exalt herself by +2. If used aboard a boat or ship, the entire ship and the surrounding sea are engulfed in a thick, obscuring fog that hides the vessel from observers and pursuers, and the fog lasts for a number of hours equal to the successes rolled."
DragonBlooded,Water,Riptide Method ,2,,"Brawl,Martial Arts","The Dragon-Blooded’s muscles surge with the inevitable fury of the undertow, drawing an enemy into an embrace from which there is no escape.","The Dragon-Blooded locks herself in a deadly embrace with an opponent, immobilizing them. By reflexively paying 1 Mote upon landing a successful unarmed attack, the Exalt locks herself and her target in place. Unless she voluntarily relinquishes the power of this Charm, neither can move from the zone they currently occupy until the Dragon-Blooded has taken another (Essence rating) turns. The initial attack adds the Exalt’s Essence rating to its base damage, as do all subsequent unarmed attacks during the duration of Riptide Method. While Riptide Method persists, the Exalt may opt not to roll to attack her target if she desires, instead automatically scoring (Essence rating) successes with an unarmed attack on each of her turns.
Attacking anyone other than her grappled target immediately ends Riptide Method. If the Dragon-Blooded is struck by an attack, Riptide Method ends immediately."
DragonBlooded,Water,Stone and River Revelation ,2,,Investigation,"The Dragon-Blooded, faced with a piece of evidence at the scene of a mystery, can follow her instincts until she reunifies it with the culprit responsible for its creation.","The character touches a piece of physical evidence, spends 1 Mote, and roll Perception + Investigation against difficulty 6. If she gains any successes, then she also gains a flash of insight which replays in her mind’s eye the events of the crime or occurrence that generated the evidence she found."
DragonBlooded,Water,Storm-Outrunning Technique ,2,,Sail,"The Dragon-Blooded exhorts her crew to bend all their efforts to the working of a ship, even as her expert eye, Essence-guided, judges the perfect trim of sail from moment to moment and the perfect bearing to take advantage of swift currents.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Intelligence + Sail against difficulty 6. The character’s ship moves at twice its normal speed (assuming there’s any wind to move it at all) for a number of hours equal to the successes rolled. In a naval chase, this lowers the difficulty to catch another ship or escape from a pursuer by –2."
DragonBlooded,Water,Sun on Water Deceit ,2,,"Empathy,Presence,Resistance","The Dragon-Blooded projects into the world only those impressions she wishes to, hiding the truth within the depths of her heart.","All rolls to discern the truthfulness of the Exalt’s actions or words are made at +1 difficulty. If the character spends 1 Mote, increase the difficulty by +3 instead for the rest of the scene, and decrease the difficulty of all Manipulation rolls she makes by –2."
DragonBlooded,Water,Thrashing Carp Serenade ,2,,Bureaucracy,"The Dragon-Blooded casts turbulent Essence into the workings of a bureau, organization, or project, damming up its efficient function.","The character can spend 2 Motes to target a specific office or project with terrible inefficiency for the rest of the current story. Everyone involved in pushing the project forward increases the difficulty of all rolls to do so by +1. In narrative terms, the project is plagued with conflicts and inefficiency and while its progress does grind forward, it does so slowly and painfully."
DragonBlooded,Water,Tides of Daana’d ,2,,"Bureaucracy,Lore,Presence,Resistance",The Dragon-Blooded may fill herself with the mercurial adaptability of water and the power of the pounding tidal wave while immersed in or surrounded by water.,"When surrounded by water (either by being immersed in it, standing in the rain, or being upon the deck of a ship on a lake or at sea), the Dragon-Blooded adds one bonus die to all rolls based upon Dexterity, Stamina, Manipulation, Appearance, or Intelligence."
DragonBlooded,Water,Distraction of the Babbling Brook ,3,,"Bureaucracy,Socialize","The Dragon-Blooded uses a dash of Essence to obfuscate her true intentions during a negotiation or business agreement, inserting an unnoticed clause of her choice into a contract or agreement.
It will become unambiguously clear upon later review, but in the heat of hammering out a deal, she manages to keep anyone from noticing its presence.",Spend 1 Mote. All other principal participants in the bargain or contract must make a Perception + Bureaucracy roll against difficulty 9 to notice the inserted clause or proviso prior to reaching a formal agreement (assuming that a formal agreement is reached). This Charm does nothing to actually enforce the contract.
DragonBlooded,Water,Dragon Mariner Method ,3,,Sail,"The Exalt is a master of all aspects of the sea and those who make their living upon it, able adopt whatever pose within that milieu suits her present needs.","Any sailor the Exalt meets instinctively recognizes her as a fellow mariner. Moreover, she can decide at any time whether she is presenting herself to be identified as an able seaman, a prize pick to crew any vessel in the world; a criminal such as a pirate or smuggler, eager to be recruited into illicit activities; or a mighty captain sure to bring wealth and glory to any who sail under her flag. This is a potent first impression, but won’t negate or erase any knowledge that an individual might already have about the Dragon-Blooded."
DragonBlooded,Water,Falsehood Unearthing Attitude ,3,,"Empathy,Investigation",The Dragon-Blooded becomes keenly aware of the disturbances and ripples in a person’s Essence that indicate deceit.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote to interrogate a statement made to the Dragon-Blooded. If the speaker is intentionally attempting to speak falsehood, the Exalt detects it as a dark shadow passing beneath the speaker’s words."
DragonBlooded,Water,Flow Past Defenses ,3,,"Archery,Martial Arts,Melee","Water finds a way through anything, given time enough. So it is with the Exalt’s attacks.","When the Exalt spends Willpower to lower the difficulty of an attack roll, its benefit extends to the next (Essence rating) attack rolls she makes during the current scene as well."
DragonBlooded,Water,Flow With Strife ,3,,"Brawl,Resistance","The Exalt falls back before an attack, absorbing its force and sending it back whence it came.","Upon being struck by an attack, reflexively spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower and roll Stamina + Resistance against difficulty 8. Each success negates one level of bashing or lethal damage, and increases the raw damage of the Exalt’s next blow against the attacker by the levels negated. This Charm can’t be used again until after the Exalt has taken a turn and a new round has begun."
DragonBlooded,Water,Geese Flying South Administration ,3,,"Bureaucracy,Occult","Sometimes a diligent leader cannot be present for even the most crucial of tasks, and must entrust her power and authority to others. The Dragon-Blooded has learned to do so, and can pour her elemental miracles into a mortal assistant, as one fills a cup with water.","Touch a mortal and spend as many Motes as desired. The mortal gains however many of her Charms the Dragon-Blooded wishes to impart, as well as a pool of Motes with which to use them equal to the Motes contributed to this Charm. While the mortal is in possession of the bestowed Charms, their original owner cannot use them, and the mortal has no way to replenish their borrowed Motes; once they’re gone, they’re gone.
This Charm lasts until the Dragon-Blooded spends a moment’s concentration to reclaim her loaned-out Charms. She cannot reclaim any unspent Motes; they are simply lost."
DragonBlooded,Water,Returning Wave Counterstrike ,3,,"Brawl,Martial Arts,Thrown","Accepting the forces turned against her, the Exalt may send them back against her attacker.","Spend 1 Mote reflexively to activate this Charm. Until the end of the current round, the Exalt reflexively counterattacks in response to every attack launched against her: For every 1 rolled on attacks directed against her, the attacker must soak two levels of damage of a type appropriate to the Dragon-Blood’s currently-equipped weapon after the attack resolves, if they are within striking range of that weapon. This Charm can’t deal out more damage in response to an attack than lower of (the Dragon-Blood’s Essence rating + 2) or the Ability governing the weapon she is fighting with."
DragonBlooded,Water,Thoughtful Gift Technique ,3,,"Bureaucracy,Investigation,Larceny","Minutely examining the situation she finds herself in and the eddies of her subject’s Essence, the Exalt intuits the precise gift or offering that would ease her way forward.","Spend 2 Motes and roll Perception + (Bureaucracy or Larceny) against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower. Success reveals what bribe, flattery, or gift will induce the target to agree to a particular thing that the Dragon-Blooded desires from them. Thoughtful Gift Technique does nothing to help procure or produce the gift in question."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Aspect-Blessed Companion ,1,,"Ride,Survival","The Dragon-Blood’s familiar is not only immune to damage from her anima flux, it also manifests an extension of her anima when she flares.","The character must have the Familiar Background to use this Charm. Her familiar is immune to damage from her anima flux, and when she flares her anima, the familiar is also surrounded in a roaring anima flux if she wishes it to be so. This is an extension of her own flux, and so uses her traits and any Charms that might be modifying her anima flux. This flux cannot harm the Exalt."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Blossom Hides Thorns ,1,,Performance,"Nature is a constant dance of life and death, but most observers see only the tranquility of the glade. So it is with the struggles of the Dragon-Blooded, who may conceal a vicious sword duel with a deathknight as a romantic waltz or bit of good-natured roughhousing.",Reflexively spend 1 Mote to entangle a scene of supernatural violence in a concealing shroud of Essence that weaves it into the normal goings-on of the world. Mortals cannot perceive the battle as anything supernatural or even truly threatening unless they suffer a direct injury from it. Essence-users must succeed at a difficulty 8 Perception + Awareness roll to notice what’s really happening.
DragonBlooded,Wood,Disease-Banishing Technique ,1,,Medicine,"By infusing a patient with the Essence of the good and growing Earth throughout the course of a treatment, the Dragon-Blooded empowers them to throw off any disease.","After a holistic regimen of traditional remedies lasting several hours, the DragonBlooded’s patient makes a Stamina + Resistance roll against difficulty (9 – the Exalt’s Medicine rating), adding one die for each Mote the Exalt spends on this Charm (if any). If the illness is considered incurable by mortal medicine, this inflicts a –3 dice penalty. A single success cures whatever ailment they are being treated for. This Charm cannot cure the Great Contagion."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Grasping Vine Shot ,1,,"Archery,Thrown","The Exalt threads the Essence of wood into a projectile. When it strikes home, a sturdy vine-rope flashes into existence, stretching between it and the hand of the Exalt who launched the projectile.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote when throwing a weapon or shooting an arrow. The vine is sturdy enough to bear the weight of up to (Essence rating) people, and will not pull a throwing knife or arrow out of whatever surface it has lodged in unless that is the Exalt’s intent. If the attack struck an opponent, then the Exalt may reflexively pull them one zone toward her by winning a contested Strength + Athletics roll (both at difficulty 6)."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Harvest of the Hunter ,1,,"Archery,Melee",Nature itself abhors the thought of the Dragon-Blooded ever being caught helpless and unarmed by her enemies. At any time she can reach into a nearby plant or wooden object and draw forth both weapon and ammunition with which to fight,"Spend an action to retrieve one of the following from any plant or wooden object or surface larger than the Exalt’s fist: A wooden Martial Arts or Melee weapon; a bow, strung with springy vines; a bundle of arrows sufficient to keep the Exalt stocked with ammunition for one battle. These weapons and arrows sublimate back into Essence at the end of the scene."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Hidden Petal Aria Method ,1,,Performance,"As beautiful flowers may conceal deadly poison, so the Dragon-Blooded’s performance contains concealed messages for select members of her audience.","Spend 1 Mote while enacting a live performance to embed a secret, hidden message inside the words, motion, or music. This hidden message can only be discerned by those the Dragon-Blooded intends to address it to."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Seed-Planting Lessons ,1,,Lore,"When the Exalt teaches or trains someone else, she may quietly embed hidden lessons into her students’ curriculum which later bear useful fruit.","This Charm is used when the Dragon-Blooded grants extended and complex instruction to another person or group of people. Giving someone instructions on how to get to the nearest teahouse isn’t sufficient to employ Seed-Planting Lessons. Teaching a farmboy how to use a sword, tutoring a young sorcerer in a new spell, or instructing a group of physicians in the proper treatment of a foreign disease — these are the sort of investments the Charm requires: instruction that will permanently improve its recipient.
After the period of tutelage finishes, recipients must make a Willpower roll against difficulty 8.
Failure causes them to form a temporary Intimacy of the Dragon-Blooded’s choosing, which persists until (tutor’s Essence rating) stories have concluded."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Sweeten-the-Tap Method ,1,,Socialize,"The Exalt exhales a pulse of Essence into a social affair, making all drink in her vicinity much richer in flavor, and powerfully intoxicating if it was not already so.","Spend 1 Mote. All potable liquids within one zone of the Exalt are affected for the rest of the scene. Even plain water becomes sweet and refreshing, while coarse wines take on the refines character of well-aged stock from a fine vineyard. Enchanted drink becomes strongly intoxicating: anyone who partakes of it treats their Willpower rating as being two lower than its true value until they next go to sleep."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Talented Improvisation ,1,,"Performance,Socialize","So bright is the Exalt’s smile, so ringing her laughter, so disarming her mannerisms that she can smoothly recover from any misstep or mistake.","Should the Dragon-Blooded botch or fail at any social roll, she may spend 1 Mote to attempt to re-roll it once."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Trail-Concealing Measure ,1,,"Stealth,Survival","The world tidies itself in the Dragon-Blooded’s wake, making it nearly impossible to tell where she has passed.","Make a Wits + Survival roll against difficulty 4, or spend 1 Mote to bypass the need to roll. Henceforth, anyone trying to track the Exalt across the route she takes for the next several hours does so at difficulty 9. This Charm may only be attempted without spending Motes once per day."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Wild-Wandering Forester Style ,1,,Survival,"Nature welcomes the return of the Dragon-Blooded. Predators avoid her, and the wilderness offers up shelter and bounty for the taking.","The Dragon-Blooded makes all Survival rolls to remain safe, comfortable, and fed in the wilderness at difficulty 3. By spending 1 Mote, she becomes immune to environmental damage from extreme weather or temperatures (but not actual flames, lava, etc) for one day."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Aegis of Grasping Branches ,2,,"Athletics,Martial Arts,Melee,Survival","While the Exalt is surrounded by branches, brambles, or other foliage, she may instinctively move in tune with the living things around her, guiding her opponents’ attacks to strike trunk and branch rather than her own flesh.","While within a heavily wooded zone such as a forest or garden, all attacks directed against the Exalt suffer a –2 dice penalty. By reflexively paying 1 Mote, she may also subtract one success from all such attacks for the next (1 + Essence rating) rounds."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Enchanting Performance ,2,,Performance,"Over the course of an intimate, one-on-one artistic performance, the Dragon-Blooded lulls her target into a suggestive state, and may plant commands deep into their psyche.","Spend 2 Motes and roll Appearance + Performance against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower rating. One or two successes will allow the Dragon-Blooded to command her target to do anything that doesn’t seem tremendously unusual or out of character. With three or four successes, she can command the target to do anything that doesn’t endanger themselves or a loved one. With five or more successes, the target will risk his life and the lives of others at the Exalt’s command.
Enchanting Performance cannot hypnotize a target into harming or killing himself, compel him into certain death, or force him to betray his Nature. It also can’t create indefinite orders like “mail me a letter every week telling me what Mnemon is doing.” Any lingering orders fade after a year has passed. Protagonists targeted by this Charm may spend 1 Willpower to escape its effects for a scene if they can cite an Intimacy that it is forcing them to act against. Spending a number of points of Willpower equal to the Exalt’s Essence rating breaks the Charm’s hold."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Bounty of Sextes Jylis ,2,,"Athletics,Awareness,Performance,Socialize",The Dragon-Blooded may fill herself with the boundless energy of life itself when surrounded by nature and growing things.,"When surrounded by plant life (whether in a forest, park, or greenhouse), the DragonBlooded adds one bonus die to all rolls based on Strength, Stamina, Charisma, Manipulation, or Perception."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Life-Swelling Sap Strike ,2,,"Archery,Thrown","In the hands of the Dragon-Blooded, wood is not merely a hard substance suitable for cracking skulls or shaping into arrows, it is a vector for life itself, and thus inimical to the Unquiet.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote when wielding a wooden weapon. For the rest of the scene, it inflicts aggravated damage to Unquiet targets, causing their flesh to untwist into fresh flowers and to transform into knotted roots."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Poisoned Tongue Technique ,2,,"Linguistics,Socialize","The Exalt may release her Essence to corrode, confuse, or corrupt the course or context of a discussion, twisting it out of true to serve her needs.","Spend 1 Mote during a scene of conversation, debate, oratory, or any other occasion where words are being spoken. The Dragon-Blooded must roll Wits + Linguistics against difficulty 7. Each success allows her to implement one of the following changes: • Alter the mood of the conversation (to one of confusion, flirtatiousness, or dismay, for example).
• Alter the primary topic of the conversation (from a formal response to new aggressions by Mask of Winters to a certain person’s all-too-public infidelities).
• Alter the way a certain speaker is coming off to others involved (as heroic, cowardly, or crude and offensive, for example).
Supernatural beings may make a reflexive Willpower roll against difficulty 8 to realize someone is tampering with the course of the discussion."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Swallows Defend the Nest ,2,,"Archery,Thrown","Guided by an unerring instinct to protect life, the Dragon-Blooded may send forth deadly projectiles to protect herself or another, parrying attacks with knives or arrows.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote in response to an attack against anyone in range of the Exalt’s weapon, and roll Dexterity + (Archery or Thrown). The attack’s difficulty is increased by one per success rolled. If and when this would drive the attack’s difficulty above 9, each success subtracts one die from the attacker’s pool. The Exalt’s roll is normally made against difficulty 7, but if parrying with wooden projectiles such as arrows or throwing batons, roll against difficulty 5. The Exalt may make one such deflecting shot per round for a number of rounds equal to (1 + her Essence rating)."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Three String Swordsman ,2,,Performance,The Exalt may transform music into both weapon and shield.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote to activate this Charm for the rest of the scene. So long as the Exalt carries some musical instrument and plays it, she is considered armed for battle. She may parry attacks by playing particularly loud and aggressive notes, causing blades to turn aside from her flesh and arrows to tumble from the air. She may conjure phantasmal attacks made of pure sound, which take the form of phantom flights of arrows, slashing blades, or charging beasts.
While using this Charm, the Exalt may calculate her Parry as (3 + Performance). Her instrument is a ranged weapon using Dexterity + Performance, with a base damage of 6L, capable of attacking up to two zones away. Upon activating this Charm, she must decide whether she wants to gain the benefits of the sword and board fighting style (in which case her Parry gains a +1 bonus), or the two-handed fighting style (in which case her musical attacks inflict 7L base damage).
Other Charms consider attacks made with Three String Swordsman to be Archery or Thrown attacks, and if another Charm demands an Archery or Thrown roll while this Charm is active, Performance may be substituted in their place."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Quarry Revelation Technique ,2,,Survival,"The Dragon-Blooded can read the shape her quarry leaves in the world; it is as though the land, the plants, the air itself conspire to lead her to her prey.","Once the character finds some evidence of a trail to follow, her player may spend 1 Mote to perfectly track the target for the next 24 hours. No roll is needed."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Wilds-Stalking Ways ,2,,Survival,"The Exalt attunes her Essence to the natural world, becoming an instinctive stalker and killer.","While within a natural environment, or while surrounded by abundant plant life in an urban environment, the Dragon-Blooded may substitute Survival in place of her Stealth and Athletics Abilities. By reflexively spending 1 Mote, she ignores all movement, environmental, and complex terrain penalties due to natural terrain complications or thick foliage, and also lowers the difficulty of all attempts to conceal herself while within a natural or vegetation-heavy environment by –1."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Wound-Closing Touch ,2,,Medicine,"The Dragon-Blooded’s ministrations fortify the burgeoning life within her patient, urging his flesh to recover in record time.","After a mere scene of treating and ministering another character, the Dragon-Blooded may spend 1 Mote and roll Intelligence + Medicine (difficulty 6). For each success, her patient converts one level of lethal damage into a level of bashing damage, or heals one level of bashing damage altogether."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Blossoms of the Hanging-Tree ,3,,"Occult,Survival","A wind blows between worlds, stirring otherworldly petals from within the Exalt’s anima. While her enemies touch these petals or smell their fragrance, they are afflicted by a weakening poison.","While the Exalt’s anima banner is burning, her player may invoke this Charm by either using an action and rolling Charisma + Survival against difficulty 8, or reflexively spending 1 Mote. All enemies within one zone of the Exalt are afflicted by the petals’ poison for as long as the character’s anima remains active and they remain in an affected zone, suffering a –3 dice penalty to all pools."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Dread Infection Strike ,3,,"Archery,Medicine,Melee","The Exalt insinuates a thread of poisoned Essence into an attack, causing any wound it might inflict to fester.","Spend 1 Mote and make an attack that inflicts lethal or aggravated damage. If the target suffers damage, then the next time they heal from their injuries and remove a wound from their health track, they must make a reflexive Stamina + Resistance roll against difficulty 9. If they fail, their injuries do not heal and they suffer another level of lethal damage. This sequence repeats itself each time they try to remove a wound from their health track, until they finally succeed at the roll or succumb to their infected wounds."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Elemental Halo’s Mercy ,3,,"Empathy,Ride","The Dragon-Blooded, through careful practice and refinement, learns to modulate her anima flux so that it discriminates between friend and foe. This visibly changes the texture and motion of her anima, making it calmer and clearer in those moments when she suppresses her flux’s destructive power. Few Dynasts bother with the rigorous meditative training necessary to learn this Charm, instead expecting the world to get out of their way once their blood is up. It is more favored in Lookshy and Prasad. Lookshy cannot afford to depend wholly upon its alliance with the Marukani to answer its needs for heavy cavalry, while in Prasad mastery of this Charm is regarded as a sign of advanced spiritual cultivation. To permit a mortal to breathe in one’s spiritual aura without being destroyed by it is to bestow a priceless blessing.","The Dragon-Blooded no longer damages anything with her anima flux that she does not mean to destroy, allowing her to perform selective miracles such as sparing her mount while still lashing her foes with bristling Essence-thorns."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Most Beneficent Seed of the Five Dragons ,3,,"Empathy,Medicine,Survival","Through the most careful cultivation of her Essence, the Dragon-Blooded awakens the seed of the other four elements within her soul.","By spending ten minutes in absolute meditation and spending 1 Mote, the DragonBlooded may change her aspect to that of a different element for 24 hours. She exchanges her anima power for that of her new aspect, adjusts her aspect affinity accordingly, and all of her Charms treat her as though her assumed aspect was her native one. She retains her usual Aspect Abilities."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Purity of Mind Method ,3,,"Empathy,Medicine","The Exalt may carefully infuse her Essence into a patient, smoothing out damage done to the psyche by trauma or hostile magic.","Spend 2 Motes, spend an hour slowly realigning the patient’s Essence flows with a holistic treatment combining elements of acupuncture, deep-muscle massage, and efficacious incense, and make a contested roll of Intelligence + Medicine against the patient’s Willpower (both at difficulty 8). If the Dragon-Blooded gains more successes, she may cleanse her patient of one Derangement (see p. XX) or remove the effects of one incident of mind or emotion- influencing magic, such as Hypnotic Tongue Technique (see p. XX) or Memory-Reweaving Discipline (see p. XX)."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Ravenous Thorn Technique ,3,,"Archery,Melee","Imbuing a wooden weapon with the febrile Essence of unchecked growth, the Dragon-Blooded fills her target’s flesh with rapidly-expanding roots and thorns that relentlessly seek the heart.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote when making an attack with a wooden weapon. If it inflicts any damage, then the target must soak a level of automatic lethal damage at the beginning of each turn for a number of turns equal to twice the Dragon-Blooded’s Essence rating."
DragonBlooded,Wood,Spring Follows Winter ,3,,"Archery,Martial Arts,Thrown",The Exalt’s attacks express the same certainty as the turning of the seasons.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote to gain the following benefit for the Exalt’s next (Essence rating) attacks: Roll the attack twice and keep the better result; if it strikes its target, also roll for damage twice and keep the better result. If the Exalt hasn’t expended this Charm’s magic by the end of the scene, it dissipates."
