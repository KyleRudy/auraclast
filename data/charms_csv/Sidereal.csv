Sidereal,General Sidereal,Excellence of the Starry Vault: (Ability) ,1,1,,,"By manipulating the threads of fate to produce the most favorable possible outcome, the Sidereal  makes the impossible almost assured.","Select one Ability when purchasing this Charm.  At any time, the player may reflexively spend 1 Essence to lower the difficulty of all actions  using the Ability by –2 (though this can’t reduce a roll’s difficulty below 3) for (Essence rating +  1) turns in combat, or minutes outside of combat. Alternately, she may add her Essence rating in  dice for the same duration. For 1 Essence and 1 Willpower, she gains both effects from a single  invocation.
This Charm can be repurchased to unlock additional Abilities, but Motes must be spent to add  dice to or reduce the difficulty of each Ability separately. Sidereals begin play with all versions  of Excellence of the Starry Vault which correspond to their Caste and Favored Abilities."
Sidereal,General Sidereal,Auspicious Prospects ,1,1,,,"All Sidereals are intrinsically attuned to the vibrations of destiny, able to pluck guiding omens  from the patterns of the world around them: the color of a messenger boy’s shoes; the alignment  of clouds and tree branches and a passing flock of birds; a child’s nursery rhyme heard at a  certain moment. Any of these things might carry a freight of meaning for the Chosen, speaking  to her of destiny’s needs. Should she see to them, she furthers the health of the fabric of  Creation.","Once per session, the Sidereal may voluntarily spend 1 Mote and roll Wits + Occult  against difficulty 7. Success allows her to ask the Storyteller one question from her caste list,  which they must answer to the best of their ability.
Chosen of Journeys may ask the following: • Where should I go next? • Where, if anywhere, does [a person or object other than the Sidereal] need to go? Chosen of Serenity may ask the following: • Who here needs my help? • What do I need to bring into this person’s life? Chosen of Battles may ask the following: • Should I escalate or de-escalate this situation? • Which side of this conflict should triumph? Chosen of Secrets may ask the following: • Should this information be buried, or brought to light? • Who here, if anyone, has a secret that needs to be revealed? Chosen of Endings may ask the following: • What here, if anything, needs to be brought to an end? • What here, if anything, must not yet be allowed to come to an end? If the Sidereal brings about the result that destiny asks of her, she discards one point of Paradox.
Sometimes destiny doesn’t wait for the Sidereal to consult it. The Storyteller may also, at any  time of their choosing, simply tell the player that the omens are gathering and they recognize the  hand of destiny at work: that they realize a great journey awaits the person that has just brought  them their tea, or that a terrible and destructive secret is going to come to light if they do not  travel to Chiaroscuro with all speed, for example.
All Sidereals begin play with this Charm for free."
Sidereal,Journeys,Adopting the Untamed Face ,1,1,,Survival,"The Sidereal learns to bend the fate that processes all that is wild, untamed, and savage around  herself as a protective weave, aiding her in dealing with feral beasts.","Whensoever the Sidereal hunts, battles, befriends, tricks, tracks, or hides from any wild  beast or one of the Lunar Exalted, the difficulty of all of her actions is reduced by –1. At the  Storyteller’s discretion, this Charm may also assist against certain wilderness or beast-associated  Exigents as well."
Sidereal,Journeys,Dreaming the Wild Lands ,1,1,,Survival,"Mirroring her Essence to the land, the Sidereal rewrites the wilderness to suit her design. She  may shift the elevation of hills, subtly bend the curve of rivers, and move trees about in any way  that suits her. Wild animals also become furious or docile at her command.","Spend 2 Motes. For the next (Essence rating) days, the Sidereal may reshape the  landscape of any untamed wilderness in whatever fashion suits her. Man-made elements such as  hunting lodges, cabins, or roads are utterly immune to alteration by this Charm."
Sidereal,Journeys,Flight of Mercury ,1,1,,"Athletics,Martial Arts,Ride",The Sidereal asserts her destiny to travel even in the face of overpowering adversity.,"If an attack directed against the Sidereal before her turn fails to strike her, it does not  prevent her from reflexively moving to another zone that round. She may also do so even if an  attack against her does succeed (Essence rating) times per battle."
Sidereal,Journeys,Glory Path ,1,1,,"Athletics,Ride","Essence enwraps the character or her mount in a nimbus of yellow light, speeding her along her  path and ensuring no obstacle can stand in her way.","Spend 1 Mote while running or riding a mount. Until she stops moving, the Sidereal’s travel speed is tripled, and she can navigate any obstacle without crash or calamity. The Sidereal  can jump chasms, run up the side of buildings, speed over the surface of water, or ride through  the densely-packed stalls and foot traffic of Nexus’s Little Market without breaking anything or  knocking anyone down."
Sidereal,Journeys,Ox-Body Technique ,1,1,,"Athletics,Resistance,Survival","Destiny demands that the Sidereal endure until her appointed hour, and her body obeys.","The character permanently gains an additional (–0) health level.
This Charm can be purchased a number of times equal to the character’s Essence rating."
Sidereal,Journeys,Pain Amplification Stratagem ,1,1,,"Empathy,Thrown","The Sidereal touches her weapon to her face, just beneath her eye, and bleeds three drops of  blood upon it to symbolize the sorrow she might theoretically feel for the violence she is about to  inflict. Her weapon resonates with her targets’ pain, becoming unerringly deadly.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the next (Essence rating + 1) rounds, all of the Sidereal’s  attacks reduce the difficulty of their damage rolls by the target’s current wound penalty. If the  target is negating their wound penalties by any means, this Charm has no power over them."
Sidereal,Journeys,Righteous Lion Defense ,1,1,,"Empathy,Sail,Survival",The Sidereal anchors her passions and convictions into the very foundation of destiny. The  weave of the world guarantees that her commitments endure.,"Any attempt to cause or force the Sidereal to betray, undermine, or abandon her  Intimacies automatically fails."
Sidereal,Journeys,Salt into Ash Sleight ,1,1,,"Empathy,Occult,Survival","Clapping her hands, the Sidereal momentarily surrounds a supernatural being in a brilliant  saffron aura. That being suddenly realizes that it has incredibly pressing business elsewhere. This  isn’t a trick or illusion: there really is an urgent reason for the target to journey elsewhere. This  Charm simply calls that fact to mind.","The Sidereal spends 1 Mote and a moment in concentration. Not only does the target  remember that it has pressing business elsewhere, but for the rest of the scene, all attempts to  drive the target away or cause him to depart — by any character, using any means, from  persuasion to violence — reduce their difficulty by one. This benefit also applies to damage rolls  on attempts to drive the creature off."
Sidereal,Journeys,Sky and Rain Mantra ,1,1,,"Sail,Survival","The Sidereal’s fingers find the strings of destiny which control the weather, and bend them to her  will.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Stamina + Survival against difficulty 7. If the Sidereal wishes to  calm the weather or produce unseasonable weather, she does so for one day per success rolled. If  she wishes to produce violent storms which raise the difficulty of all actions attempted by those  exposed to them by +1, then the storm lasts for one hour per success rolled."
Sidereal,Journeys,Sky Spirit Demand ,1,1,,"Occult,Survival","The Sidereal makes her Essence a mirror of the clouds and wind, reflecting her priorities onto a  spirit who represents those things.",Spend 1 Mote and roll Manipulation + Survival against difficulty (3 + spirit’s Essence  rating) when dealing with an air elemental or a god of the wind or sky. Success allows the  Sidereal to give the spirit a temporary Intimacy matching one of her own Intimacies for the  remainder of the current story.
Sidereal,Journeys,Stone Skipping Spirit ,1,1,,Sail,"The Sidereal blows into the winds of fate, stirring them in favor of a particular ship’s voyage.","The Sidereal spends 2 Motes while focusing on a particular ship that she can see, then  rolls Wits + Sail against difficulty 5. For a number of days equal to the successes rolled, that ship  enjoys fair conditions, calm seas, and untroubled sailing. All Sail rolls to navigate, maneuver,  operate, and guide the vessel are made at difficulty 6, even if attempting to steer through a  treacherous reef in the midst of a hurricane. If the ship was already taking on water when this  Charm was used, it ceases to sink until the Charm elapses."
Sidereal,Journeys,Unswerving Juggernaut Principle ,1,1,,"Athletics,Resistance,Ride","Yellow stardust cascades around the Sidereal and glitters in her footsteps. So long as she moves  forward without stopping, she is inexhaustible.","So long as she keeps running or riding in a more or less straight line, the Sidereal is  tireless. She needs not eat, sleep, or rest. She gains +3 soak while running all-out in this fashion,  beginning after two rounds of constant acceleration, and being attacked once this soak has  manifested does not immobilize her if it occurs before her turn. The difficulty of rolls to escape  from pursuit are lowered by –1.
If the cause for the Sidereal’s journey ceases to apply (her pursuers have given up; the old man  she’s trying to retrieve medicine for has died), she becomes instinctively aware of this fact."
Sidereal,Journeys,Becoming the Wilderness ,2,1,,Survival,"The Sidereal devises and oversees an intensive training regimen for a small group of students in  which she weaves a challenging ordeal of wilderness survival from the threads of destiny. Those  who come through the training are vastly empowered by her tutelage, wise in the ways of  journeys and meeting dread necessity.","The Sidereal spends an entire night consulting the stars, and then an entire day weaving  a customized training scenario into the fabric of destiny, and spends 5 Motes, 1 Willpower. She  must then, within the next seven days, touch each student she wishes to put through the training,  spending 1 Mote per student. Students need not consent to this training or realize they are  undergoing it. The Sidereal may train up to (Essence rating) students at a time. Once she has  attached all the students she wishes to train to the destiny she’s woven, the Charm takes effect.
If used to train antagonists, the Charm unfolds in a largely narrative fashion, usually occurring over the course of a week, at the end of which they may gain a new appropriate Aptitude chosen  from among the following: Athletic displays, delivering messages, overcoming hardship, sailing,  throwing attacks, or wilderness survival. Once every other story, if they are Exalted, they can  gain a new power relating to one of those Aptitudes.
If used to train protagonists, this Charm either occurs during about a week of downtime, or  consumes a session of gameplay, as the group prefers, during which they are drawn into some  challenging survival ordeal. If they overcome it, then the next time they spend experience, they  may treat up to three of the following as Favored Attributes or Abilities (the Sidereal chooses  which when she devises the regimen): Stamina, Perception, Athletics, Linguistics, Martial Arts,  Resistance, Ride, Sail, Survival, and Thrown. This discount applies both to buying Ability dots  and to buying Charms. This Charm cannot provide any benefit again until a protagonist has spent  experience points on something, and only provides a discount for one purchase (so if the player  has enough normal experience points banked to buy an Ability dot, and enough supernal  experience points banked to buy a Charm, she could only apply the discount to one or the other,  not both)."
Sidereal,Journeys,Breaking the Wild Mortal ,2,1,,Ride,"Deciding to incorporate a mortal into her life, the Sidereal summons a bit made of stardust and  sets it into his mouth, linking his destiny to her own.","The Sidereal spends 1 Mote to conjure the bit. Mortals always consent to letting her put  it in their mouth, then promptly forget that humiliating experience as it vanishes. Alternately, the  Sidereal may spend a turn in concentration, spend 1 Mote, and petition Mercury to guide her to a  mortal suitable to become part of her life. She may attach one simple descriptor to the sort of  mortal she seeks, such as a blacksmith, poet, or a good Gateway player. Her wanderings soon  bring her to a suitable individual, who again accepts the stardust bit.
In either case, using this Charm causes the Sidereal to gain a dot of the Acquaintances  Background. If the mortal she chooses is not suitable for riding (as most aren’t, excepting some  Wyld mutants), this Charm’s cost increases to 1 Mote, 3 Willpower."
Sidereal,Journeys,Essence Thorn Practice ,2,1,,Thrown,"The Sidereal draws a yellow Essence-sculpted knife from the armory of destiny. Its fate is to  strike its target. She may ride the wind of its passage toward her foe if she likes, the better to  deliver a coup-de-grace.","Spend 1 Mote and make a Dexterity + Thrown attack, using a conjured weapon with  base damage 5L. This attack is undodgeable; antagonists suffer a –2 penalty to their Defense. It  has a maximum range of (Sidereal’s Essence rating) zones, and the Sidereal may reflexively  advance one zone in the direction she hurled the weapon if she wishes.
If this weapon strikes one of the Unquiet, who have already passed through the gate of death, it  draws them closer to life. Rather than suffering damage, they lower their Resolve for the rest of  the story by one point per point of damage they would have suffered had the Essence Thorn been  a normal knife. An Unquiet target reduced to 0 Resolve is plunged into disorienting memories,  illusions, and hallucinations of life. They can take no actions save to wander about in reverie,  defend themselves, or try to escape. After 24 hours, their Resolve returns to 1."
Sidereal,Journeys,Godly Companion ,2,1,,"Bureaucracy,Ride","The Sidereal petitions Heaven to uplift one of her companions, elevating a Familiar from animal  to little god.","The Sidereal’s familiar becomes a lesser divinity. It becomes intelligent and capable of  speaking Old Realm as well as the Sidereal’s native language. It has all the standard features of a  god, including being naturally dematerialized, and having the ability to use the powers  Materialize and Measure the Wind. It gains Essence 2. It may use a turn to shift between its  animal form and a humanoid form with strong animal features.
Heaven registers the Familiar as a small god whose duties are to serve the Sidereal as an  assistant. One of its new duties under Heaven is to routinely file reports on the Sidereal’s  activities. Although these reports are theoretically vulnerable to interception and inspection, in  practice they are generally rushed unopened and unread through the Bureau of Destiny’s mail  room and forwarded to the august weaver Caturasya, who eats them."
Sidereal,Journeys,Heartless Maiden Trance ,2,1,,Resistance,The Sidereal’s chest convulses as she swallows her heart. Henceforth she becomes as unfeeling  as a stone.,"Spend 1 Mote. The Sidereal no longer suffers penalties from wounds, poison, hunger,  thirst, disease, fatigue, inclement weather, or temperature. She doesn’t need to breathe. She can  still be killed, but cannot be rendered unconscious by any means; if Incapacitated by bashing  damage, she can remain upright and active. So long as she maintains this Charm — and it lasts  until she takes a turn to restore her heart — the Sidereal automatically fails all Empathy rolls, is  not considered to possess any Intimacies, and does not regain Essence when the sun sets."
Sidereal,Journeys,Mirror Shattering Method ,2,1,,Sail,"The Sidereal casts salt into a puddle or body of water beneath her. Its surface breaks and  dissolves into foaming whitecaps, and the Sidereal vanishes, traveling upon a white field that is,  from moment to moment, water, wind-blown flower petals, or butterflies. She travels through  paths beyond the normal logic of the world.","Spend 3 Motes when either standing upon or above water, or when aboard a ship or  other construction upon or above water. If the Sidereal is aboard a ship, this Charm transports it  and its passengers along with her. She or her ship travels at twice their normal speed, ignoring  restrictions of geography; a ship may sail deep inland under the auspices of this Charm, its  presence felt only as a slight stirring in the wind. The Sidereal may travel in this fashion for up to  five days before she and her vessel must return to the world (ideally in a place with water if she  took a ship with her). Alternately, the Sidereal may steer deep into the field of white for five days  in order to arrive somewhere in the waters of Heaven, Hell, or the Underworld."
Sidereal,Journeys,Unwavering Well-Being Meditation ,2,1,,Resistance,The Sidereal’s calm certainty in her own destiny becomes a shield which deflects unexpected  misfortune.,"Anyone who strikes at the Sidereal unaware must succeed at a difficulty 9 Willpower  roll, or else lose make their attack roll at difficulty 9 and lose two successes from it. The Sidereal  adds her Essence rating to her soak against all unexpected sources of damage, and rolls to soak  against unexpected attacks at –2 difficulty."
Sidereal,Journeys,Willful Weapon Method ,2,1,,Thrown,"The Sidereal hurls her weapon’s shadow. Should it intersect the shadow of an opponent, her  weapon vanishes from her hand and reappears, embedded in his chest.","Spend 1 Mote when attacking with a weapon. The attack is unblockable; antagonists  suffer a –2 penalty to their Defense. This attack is compatible with any sort of weapon that  doesn’t fire ammunition, but is most often employed with thrown weapons since it leaves the  Sidereal disarmed if it succeeds."
Sidereal,Journeys,Yellow Path ,2,1,,"Athletics,Survival",The shining yellow light of destiny illuminates the fastest — if not most straightforward or safest  — path to the Sidereal’s destination.,"The Sidereal fixes a destination firmly in mind. Spend 1 Mote and roll Wits + Survival  against difficulty 6. For one success, the Sidereal finds a path that cuts her travel time in half. For  three successes, if the character has a deadline and there is any possibility of making it on time,  the Sidereal does so. Five successes allow the Sidereal to arrive by the time of her deadline or  appointment no matter what."
Sidereal,Journeys,Five Ordeals Odyssey ,3,1,,Sail,"The Sidereal conjures forth a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Maiden at Sea and  casts it at a hazard or adversarial force that impedes her progress during a journey by water,  where it hovers wreathed in dandelion-hued lightning. When she overcomes that particular  adversity, the prayer strip detonates and sweeps it away, strengthening the implicit bias of fate  and destiny in support of her future success.","Spend 2 Motes and spend a turn summoning the prayer strip. This Charm does nothing  to overcome the hazard or opposition, but if the Sidereal manages to defeat it, then it violently  sweeps all remnants aside: a hurricane is blasted apart leaving clear skies; a pirate ship is  shattered into kindling; a sea monster’s corpse is incinerated. In the wake of the prayer strip’s  triumphant destruction, the Sidereal increases her Essence rating by one for the rest of the story.
“A journey by water” generally means across the sea, but this Charm also works when traveling  by river or across the dead waters of the Underworld. Five Ordeals Odyssey can only be utilized  if the Sidereal is engaged in purposeful travel; she can’t just sail in circles looking for trouble to  power herself up with.
This Charm may also be used on land if the Sidereal can arrange some symbolic trapping of a  journey by sea, such as standing upon a wooden conveyance, surrounding herself with sailors, or  becoming drunk on grog, but the cost to do so rises to 7 Motes."
Sidereal,Journeys,Life Gets Worse Approach ,3,1,,"Archery,Thrown","The Sidereal makes the Inferior Sign of the Gull over her weapon, whispers to it to seek its  target, and attacks. Not only is the shot quite deadly, but if it strikes, it bends the fate of all other  harmful things toward the target.","Spend 1 Mote and make a ranged attack. If it strikes, the attack adds the Sidereal’s  Essence rating to its base damage. Moreover, until the victim spends a turn drawing out the  offending knife or arrow, all other ranged attacks suffer –2 difficulty to strike him. If left in place  long enough, the wound may even attract stray insects and floating debris."
Sidereal,Journeys,One Direction Invocation ,3,1,,Resistance,"The Sidereal summons a prayer strip scribed with Scripture of the Eternal Maiden, and affixes it  to her forehead. This script names a goal — grand or simple, it matters not — which the Exalt  then pursues with single-minded fervor. Until she achieves her goal, she forsakes her name and  identity, but becomes nigh-unstoppable.","Spend 3 Motes and a turn to activate this Charm. Until the Sidereal achieves her goal,  almost nobody not directly in her presence can remember her, and even those individuals must  roll Intelligence + Investigation at difficulty 9 to remember her name, even if they are normally  immune to Arcane Fate. The Sidereal gains a new Intimacy dedicated to fulfilling her goal. The  Sidereal must spend a Willpower point to do anything completely unrelated to her goal, and all  rolls which don’t directly further her goal are made against difficulty 9. While this Charm  remains in effect, the character heals all bashing damage at the beginning of each turn, or one  level of lethal damage. Every hour, she heals one level of aggravated damage.
The Sidereal may end this Charm at any time by removing the prayer strip and casting it aside,  but cannot reclaim her name or identity until she completes her goal. If this becomes impossible,  then both are lost — even the Exalt can no longer remember them — and she must work to  establish a new name and identity."
Sidereal,Journeys,Optimistic Security Practice ,3,1,,"Empathy,Resistance","The Sidereal passes a hand over the weave of fate, infecting it with her own generosity of spirit.  The universe becomes very protective of her, turning aside all sources of harm.","The Sidereal reflexively spends 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, she adds her Empathy  rating to her soak dice (minimum of +1 die added). Any being whose Willpower rating is lower  than the Sidereal’s Empathy must spend one Willpower point each time they attack her, or the  attack automatically fails. Antagonists must lower their Resolve by 1 for the rest of the story,  though they need not spend down below Resolve 1. This Charm doesn’t function if the Sidereal  is wearing armor: destiny frowns on those who hedge their bets."
Sidereal,Journeys,Riding the Dragon ,3,1,,Ride,"The Sidereal seizes a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Desirable Maiden from thin  air, burning with brilliant yellow Essence, and affixes it to the forehead of a mortal strongly  connected to the weave of her life. The mortal transforms into a mighty dragon who serves as the  Sidereal’s obedient mount for a time; afterwards, it transforms back into the mortal it formerly  was, but that individual’s mind is shattered beyond repair.","Spend 3 Motes to summon the prayer strip. Upon affixing it to the forehead of a mortal  Acquaintance, they transform into a mighty celestial dragon for one scene, which will allow her  to ride it and obey her commands. At the end of the scene their body returns to normal, but their  mind is riddled with multiple Derangements, leaving them barely functional if not entirely  catatonic. The Acquaintance dot they represent is lost.
The Dragon of Mercury Aptitudes: Battle, fly, intimidate.
Expertise: 15; Utility: 5 Base Damage: 4L Defense: 8; Soak: 3 Resolve: 9; Essence: 5 Health: –0x10/–1x3/–2x3/–5x3/Incap  Powers The following powers are permanently active: Celestial Mount: The Dragon of Mercury can bear up to a six riders into battle on  its back.
Fly: The Dragon of Mercury can fly at 500 miles per hour.
The following powers are limited. The Dragon of Mercury may use precisely one  of the powers listed below during each round: Dragon’s Suspire: The Dragon of Mercury uses its turn to unleash an unblockable  plume of saffron fire. Antagonists targeted by this attack reduce their Defense by – 2. The attack targets an entire zone adjacent to the dragon, rolling Expertise against  the highest Defense present in that zone. It has a base damage of 5L.
Principle of Motion: The Dragon of Mercury takes five turns during the current  round. It will not take two turns consecutively. Once all of its allies have acted, it  holds any of its remaining turns until the end of the round, after all other characters  have acted, and then unleashes them. It can reflexively move one zone before each  turn.
Terrifying Roar: The Dragon of Mercury uses its turn to unleash an earthshattering roar. Everyone who hears it save for those riding on the dragon must  make a Willpower roll against difficulty 9 or lose their next turn."
Sidereal,Journeys,Unrelenting Torment Technique ,3,1,,Thrown,"The Sidereal hurls a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Maiden and the Shadow at an  opponent. It adheres to her enemy, wreathing him in a pulsing yellow glow, and condemns him  to mutual destruction.","The Sidereal spends 2 Motes, 1 Willpower and makes a Dexterity + Thrown attack  against an enemy up to two zones away. If it succeeds, the enemy is cursed by the Sidereal’s  prayer strip until the Sidereal chooses to nullify its power or until he spends a turn physically  tearing the strip off of himself (requiring a difficulty 9 Strength + Athletics roll). The Sidereal  can have only one active prayer strip empowered by this Charm at a time.
While the target is cursed, then at the end of any round in which the Sidereal suffers damage, if  she has a free hand she reflexively hurls a hatchet made of yellow Essence at the cursed target. It  passes through all obstacles to unerringly strike him, inflicting (Essence rating) dice of lethal  damage and healing a number of the Sidereal’s health boxes equal to the damage inflicted.
Despite understanding the ramifications of his actions, the target must succeed at a difficulty 8  Willpower roll each round or else use his turn attacking the Sidereal. This compulsion abates if  he can no longer see the Sidereal."
Sidereal,Journeys,Wilderness-Commanding Practice ,3,1,,Survival,"The Sidereal casts a prayer strip into the air marked with the Scripture of the Maiden Entombed,  which sheds formless golden phantoms. It bends the destiny of the wilderness to her aid in all  respects, temporarily making her the master of a forest, tundra, coral reef, stretch of desert, or  other untamed frontier.","The Sidereal spends 3 Motes, 1 Willpower to co-opt the fate of a wilderness area for  roughly ten miles in every direction around the location of her prayer strip. So long as she  remains within sight of the prayer strip, she is automatically aware of the location and  movements of all individuals she would find of interest within the enchanted wilderness. If  someone uses an effect that perfectly defeats supernatural tracking, she may make an Essence  roll against difficulty 9 to track them anyway. She can lower the difficulty of anyone in the  region’s Survival rolls by –3, or reduce their dice pool for Survival actions to 0 before the effect  of Charms, as she chooses.
She may also convey the location of someone within the enchanted wilderness to a local beast or  spirit by paying 1 Mote and rolling Manipulation + Survival against a difficulty of the beast or  spirit’s Resolve. Success causes the affected beast or spirit to become instinctively aware of the  target’s location, and to develop a temporary Intimacy of fearful hatred toward them as they  become instinctively convinced that the intruder is a threat.
This Charm lasts for five days. If there are small areas of developed habitation or infrastructure  within the wilderness (such as a tiny village or a road), they and everyone within them are  beyond the Sidereal’s power to track and influence."
Sidereal,Serenity,Absence ,1,1,,Athletics,"Predicting the path of her foes’ attacks well in advance, the Sidereal contrives to be somewhere  else.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the next (Essence) rounds, all attacks against the  Sidereal subtract one success."
Sidereal,Serenity,Avoidance Kata ,1,1,,Athletics,There are some problems whose best solution is to have not been there to get into them in the  first place. The Sidereal can escape from danger (or just meeting tedious people at parties) by  retroactively having been somewhere else all along.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote within the first minute after encountering someone socially or  within the first two rounds of combat. The Sidereal relocates immediately to somewhere else she  might plausibly have been instead, and her magic amends destiny to patch up the inconsistencies  as best it can, giving everyone involved new memories of the Sidereal not having been present  where she was, and having been present where she now is… although they don’t actually lose their existing memories of the Sidereal having been present before she absented herself, or not  having been present before she appeared. Those old memories just… don’t make as much sense  as the new ones, given the amended circumstances.
This magic also doesn’t remove the consequences of actions anyone took before the Sidereal  made herself absent, so if she stabbed someone before vanishing, they’re still perforated and  bleeding, even though the Sidereal was never there to perform the stabbing to begin with. Maybe  they just burst into cuts spontaneously? It happens sometimes.
The limitation that the Sidereal can only go somewhere else she might have plausibly been  makes Avoidance Kata good for escaping danger, but bad for escaping confinement. A Sidereal  who finds a group of inmates coming to murder her in her prison cell might have plausibly been  under interrogation down the hall instead, but by that point it’s implausible that she wasn’t in  prison at all."
Sidereal,Serenity,Blue Vervain Binding ,1,1,,Linguistics,"The Sidereal conducts a minute-long formal blessing in Old Realm. It ties together the fates of  two beings (one of whom can be the Sidereal herself). After the successful conclusion of the  ceremony, the two beings can forever after understand one another and make themselves  understood, regardless of any barriers of language or even physical or mental disability.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Intelligence + Linguistics (difficulty 6) to establish the binding,  whose effects are permanent."
Sidereal,Serenity,Destiny-Knitting Entanglement ,1,1,,Craft,"The Sidereal entangles her destiny with that of one or more objects which interest her. She may  henceforth always know where that object resides within the grand movements of destiny, or call  it to her hand by tugging on the threads of fate.","Spend 1 Mote to entangle an object in the Sidereal’s possession. She may entangle a  total number of objects equal to her Craft rating. If she wishes to abandon her connection to an  object, doing so takes only a turn of concentration.
While an object is entangled with the Sidereal’s destiny, she may reflexively spend 1 Mote to  gain a general awareness of where it is and what’s going on with it, such as “the object is in a  scavenger lord’s treasure-vault somewhere in Kirighast” or “the object is being carried in a  Solar’s backpack through a snowfield somewhere in the North.” She may also reflexively spent 1 Mote and describe a means by which the object returns to her  possession: “A thief steals it from the vault and is forced to flee the city.” “The Solar is chased  south by the Wyld Hunt.” This may or may not work, depending on the plausibility of the  request and the efforts of gods, demons, and heroes to strive against the nudging of fate, but if  the Sidereal tries often enough, the object will eventually return to her.
If the object is within one zone of the Sidereal, she may reflexively draw it back to her hand by  simply tugging on a string of fate at any time."
Sidereal,Serenity,Elemental Vision ,1,1,,"Craft,Empathy","Each of the Maidens resonates with a particular element. Fortifying the connections between the  Essence of this element and her personal destiny, the Sidereal becomes highly adept at  influencing those who also dwell within the element’s sway.","Upon learning this Charm, the Sidereal permanently lowers the difficulty of all social  influence rolls directed against Dragon-Blooded who match her Maiden’s element by –1, and  against elementals or gods who resonate with her Maiden’s element by –2. Mercury resonates  with air, Venus with wood, Mars with fire, Jupiter with water, and Saturn with earth."
Sidereal,Serenity,Excellent Implementation of Objectives ,1,1,,Craft,"Fixing the end result of some work of craftsmanship or creativity in her mind, the Sidereal deftly  weaves its design into the pattern of destiny. The world hastens to ensure its creation.","Spend 1 Mote to bless a project to create, modify, or repair something. The Sidereal can  work five times faster than normal when laboring on that project."
Sidereal,Serenity,Faultless Ceremony ,1,1,,"Linguistics,Socialize","When the Sidereal officiates over a ceremony, her actions impart a meaningful bias to destiny  within the purview of her caste. The world will bend in its best attempt to impart happiness and  fertility on a couple wed by a Chosen of Serenity; a Chosen of Endings who oversees the  conclusion of a dead man’s affairs speeds those affairs toward a swift, equitable, and relatively  painless resolution; and a warship launched by a Chosen of Battles will find fortune and  opportunity in war, at least up to the point that the influence of happenstance and circumstance  can influence its success or failure.","There are no dice rolls or resource costs associated with this Charm. It’s a permanent  modification to the impact of the Sidereal’s actions upon the world. If mechanics are needed,  assume that the difficulty of an actions in line with the Sidereal’s blessings are made at –1  difficulty once per scene, but primarily this Charm is a narrative device, and it falls upon the  Storyteller to depict its impact in the world accordingly."
Sidereal,Serenity,Ice and Fire Binding ,1,1,,"Empathy,Linguistics","The Sidereal conducts an hour-long ritual in Old Realm, conjuring forth a fire elemental chosen  by destiny and binding it by the authority of the Maiden of Serenity. For one cycle — three  months — the elemental is bound to seek the joy, health, and pleasure of those around it.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Intelligence + Linguistics (difficulty 9) to establish the binding.
The Sidereal must roll more successes than the conjured elemental’s Essence rating. Other  Sidereals can join in on the ritual, rolling and contributing successes of their own; they need not  know this Charm to do so. Once the binding concludes, the elemental is set free, his memory  wiped clean of all recollection of who summoned or bound him."
Sidereal,Serenity,Hot-Eyed Snake Whispering ,1,1,,Socialize,"Whenever the Sidereal senses that others’ trust in her words is faltering, she can gently nudge the  threads of fate to lend additional urgency and impact to her statements, causing them to resonate  with listeners’ most deeply held inner truths.","Spend 1 Mote to re-roll any Empathy, Linguistics, Presence, Performance, or Socialize roll, keeping the preferred result."
Sidereal,Serenity,World-Shaping Artistic Vision ,1,1,,Socialize,"The Sidereal develops a signature specialty in manipulating the threads of fate, which slightly  influences her appearance over time. A Sidereal who specializes in destiny manipulation “in the  halls of power” becomes more urbane and imposing, while one who specializes “against wicked  spirits” may take on a shamanic or martial aspect, clothes dramatically stirred by an unseen wind  from time to time.","Define a narrow specialty such as “rural communities,” “against wicked spirits,”  “formal debates,” or “between sunrise and noon.” All actions the Sidereal takes which fall under  this specialty reduce their difficulty by one. This specialty should not encompass the totality of  the use of an Ability or the totality of the scope of a Maiden’s purview, and so “when speaking”  or “in battle” are not valid specialties."
Sidereal,Serenity,Favorable Inflection Procedure ,2,1,,"Empathy,Linguistics","The Sidereal may speak a being’s name or nickname with an inflection which affirms and  completes their sense of being in the world, granting a momentary gift of true inner peace.","Speak the target’s name and roll Charisma + (Empathy or Linguistics) against a  difficulty of the target’s Willpower rating. Success creates a moment of peace, happiness, and  personal connection to the Sidereal. If the target is upset or violent, he loses his train of thought and forgets whatever has caused his unhappiness, although events can actively remind him (such  as noticing the Sidereal standing over the murdered bodies of his family, covered in their blood)."
Sidereal,Serenity,Heart-Brightening Gathering ,2,1,,Survival,"The Sidereal devises and oversees an intensive training regimen for a small group of students in  which she weaves a series of social difficulties and complications from the threads of destiny.  Those who come through the training are vastly empowered by her tutelage, gifted in the  measure of society and personal elegance, and able to tell when it’s time to cut and leave.","The Sidereal spends an entire night consulting the stars, and then an entire day weaving  a customized social milieu into the fabric of destiny, and spends 5 Motes, 1 Willpower. She must  then, within the next seven days, touch each student she wishes to put through the training,  spending 1 Mote per student. Students need not consent to this training or realize they are  undergoing it. The Sidereal may train up to (Essence rating) students at a time. Once she has  attached all the students she wishes to train to the destiny she’s woven, the Charm takes effect.
If used to train antagonists, the Charm unfolds in a largely narrative fashion, usually occurring  over the course of a week, at the end of which they may gain a new appropriate Aptitude chosen  from among the following: Any manner of artistic performance, any manner of craftsmanship,  avoiding danger, etiquette, poetry, or understanding others. Once every other story, if they are  Exalted, they can gain a new power relating to one of those Aptitudes.
If used to train protagonists, this Charm either occurs during about a week of downtime, or  consumes a session of gameplay, as the group prefers, during which they are drawn into some  complex social situation. If they overcome it, then the next time they spend experience, they may  treat up to three of the following as Favored Attributes or Abilities (the Sidereal chooses which  when she devises the regimen): Manipulation, Appearance, Athletics, Craft, Empathy,  Linguistics, Martial Arts, Performance, Presence, and Socialize. This discount applies both to  buying Ability dots and to buying Charms. This Charm cannot provide any benefit again until a  protagonist has spent experience points on something, and only provides a discount for one  purchase (so if the player has enough normal experience points banked to buy an Ability dot, and  enough supernal experience points banked to buy a Charm, she could only apply the discount to  one or the other, not both)."
Sidereal,Serenity,Implicit Construction Methodology ,2,1,,Craft,"The Sidereal conjures a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of Lover and Maiden and twists it  about her wrists, where it becomes a set of cold blue bindings. By the binding of her hands, the  Sidereal induces fate to work on her behalf, finishing a crafting project without her further  intervention. ","The Sidereal spends 2 Motes, 1 Willpower. The Exalt names a Craft project whose  materials she has already gathered. The processes of fate perform the work of crafting it for her,  without her activity or presence being required. Mundane objects take a scene to construct,  artifacts a day, and large-scale constructions such as ships or manses a month. All of the dice on  a single Craft roll toward the completion of the project are converted to successes. If this doesn’t  produce enough successes to complete the project, then destiny abandons its workings with the  creation still incomplete. Implicit Construction Methodology can only enhance a single roll per  project.
The Sidereal’s wrists remain bound for the duration of this Charm’s mystic construction,  inflicting a –3 penalty on all dice pools using her hands."
Sidereal,Serenity,Joy in Adversity Stance ,2,1,,Empathy,"The Sidereal dances to safety, and all Creation rejoices, affirming her being with an influx of  Essence flavored with the tang of Serenity.","At the end of any round in which the Sidereal successfully Dodged an attack, she  regains 1 Mote. This Charm doesn’t activate if the Sidereal used Duck Fate or some other form  of perfect defense to remove any doubt about her safety, nor if the attack was not truly intended  to harm her or if it was launched by someone so weak that he posed her no true danger."
Sidereal,Serenity,Life Without Compunction ,2,1,,"Bureaucracy,Socialize","Everyone knows that those with the right connections can make legal crimes simply disappear.  The Sidereal knows similar tricks with which to bribe destiny to make a social crime vanish.  Paying a small tithe of her Essence to the universe, the Sidereal renders some social blunder or  taboo violation that she or someone else has committed broadly acceptable to those who know of  it.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Manipulation + Socialize against difficulty 8. Success ensures  that nobody much gives a damn about the gaffe, whatever it may have been. Those who are  pressed on the issue may make weak excuses or issue paint-by-numbers condemnations, but they  don’t really care. With three or more successes, the character responsible for the social breach  somehow comes off as an admirable rebel (i.e. a social critic who makes a bold, daring statement  by pissing on Chejop Kejak’s shoes). It would be reprehensible if anyone else did it, but in this case it’s not only okay, it’s laudable.
Socially acceptable acts may still be illegal, and unmotivated constables are usually still willing  to detain criminals."
Sidereal,Serenity,Mending Warped Designs ,2,1,,Craft,The Sidereal may repair damage to the weave of fate inflicted by those who dwell outside of  Heaven’s regard.,"The Sidereal may spend 1 Mote and roll Dexterity + Craft. If she is healing a  character’s wounds, the difficulty is 6 and one level of bashing or lethal damage is restored per  success, or one level of aggravated damage per two successes. If she is trying to cleanse a Wyld  mutation or similar curse, such as to free someone from possession by a ghost, the difficulty is 8.  If she is trying to repair damage done to a zone (such as by a Deathlord casting Rain of Doom, or  reducing the intensity of Wyld taint in that zone by one level), the difficulty is 9.
This Charm can only heal or repair damage caused by beings native to or steeped in the power of  the Underworld, Hell, the Wyld, or similar strange realms such as Autochthonia."
Sidereal,Serenity,Neighborhood Relocation Scheme ,2,1,,Athletics,"The Sidereal summons a long cerulean prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Hunted  Maiden and binds it around her waist, where it becomes a band of Essence the color of a clear  sky. She connects herself to the destiny of the landscape around her, and then begins to run,  dragging the local geography along in her wake until it has been relocated to a more auspicious  location.","Spend 3 Motes. The Sidereal connects herself to all geographic features and buildings  within (Essence rating) miles (although she can target a smaller area, if desired), and may drag  them somewhere else by walking or running: no other manner of conveyance is acceptable,  although she can increase her running speed by as many forms of magic as she may have  available. The Sidereal must soak one level of bashing damage each hour until she releases this  Charm, which cannot be healed while it remains active.
This Charm isn’t destructive. The relocated geography slides smoothly through the world,  rerouting existing terrain around itself as it goes, and when it arrives in its new location, it  integrates into the existing landscape in a way that makes sense. For example, a borough moved  from one end of a city to the other would configure itself so that all of its sewage lines are still  connected to the grid in a functional manner, and doesn’t make complete hash of the city’s roads.  Likewise, destiny “fills in” the missing gap left behind by the Sidereal’s efforts with a new  geographical arrangement that makes sense for the location, whether that means collapsing  surrounding neighborhoods together, or simply creating a new patch of generic parks or  woodland. Even the dragon lines reroute themselves so that a Demesne relocated by this Charm  doesn’t have its power disrupted.
As far as the world is concerned, the new geographical configuration is the way things have  always been; old land surveys and other records reflect as much, and people form new memories  of the relocated land having always been where it is now… although they also retain their old  memories of it having been somewhere else."
Sidereal,Serenity,Shun the Smiling Lady ,2,1,,"Empathy,Socialize","Fixing an individual’s name or face in her mind, the Sidereal strikes their name out of the book  of love.","Spend 2 Motes and roll Manipulation + Socialize against a difficulty of the target’s  Willpower. Success curses them for one day per success. They have an effective rating of  Appearance 0 while under the curse (although their physical form doesn’t change), and if they wish to use any sort of supernatural power which leverages unnatural appeal (such as WarmFaced Seduction Style) they must first spend a Willpower point to do so (or, if an antagonist,  reduce their Resolve by one for the rest of the story). If anyone of a lower Essence rating than the  Sidereal has romantic feelings for the target, this curse terminates those feelings instantly. They  do not automatically reappear when the curse ends."
Sidereal,Serenity,Song of Spirit Persuasion ,2,1,,Performance,"The Sidereal sings a lay woven into the stars by Venus, which completes the tensions and  uncertainties that underlie all of the spirits of the terrestrial world.","Spend 2 Motes and roll Manipulation + Performance against a difficulty of an elemental  or elementally-aligned god’s Resolve. If the Sidereal rolls successes equal to or greater than the  spirit’s Essence rating, they become an ally (as per the Allies Background) for the rest of the  story. At the end of the story, the spirit forgets why they granted the Sidereal their favor, and will  no longer trouble themselves on her behalf. Treat the Resolve of spirits of wood and fire as two  lower than their true rating."
Sidereal,Serenity,Trouble Reduction Strategy ,2,1,,Athletics,"Foreseeing doom for those she cares for, the Sidereal may twist the threads of fate on their  behalf.","The Sidereal may use the Charms Absence, Avoidance Kata, and Duck Fate to protect  her allies as well as herself. By reflexively paying 1 extra Mote when activating any of those  Charms, she may invoke them on behalf of all of her allies within the same zone as well as to  protect herself. Characters who do not wish for this protection may reflexively reject it. Duck  Fate may only activate once per round to protect characters other than the Sidereal."
Sidereal,Serenity,Cash and Murder Games ,3,1,,Socialize,"Brutally looping several threads of destiny together, the Sidereal informs the world that one  character has dominion over another — generally through fear or desire, sexual or otherwise — and fate acknowledges that this is so.","Spend 2 Motes and roll Manipulation + Socialize, opposed by the Willpower of the  target to be dominated, both at difficulty 6. If the Sidereal gains more successes, then they are  enthralled, intimidated, or impressed to the point of servitude by the character granted power  over them. This Charm can be resisted for a scene by spending 1 point of Willpower (or reducing  an Antagonist’s Resolve by 1 for the rest of the story), and once a number of Willpower points  have been spent equal to the successes the by which the Sidereal won when activating Cash and  Murder games, its power comes to an end. The Sidereal can name herself as the beneficiary of  this Charm, if she likes."
Sidereal,Serenity,Defense of Shining Joy ,3,1,,Performance,"Taking up fate’s threads between her fingers and infusing herself with the Essence of the dance,  the Sidereal’s every movement becomes the perfect instinctive match of the movements of those  who move against her, allowing her to smoothly pirouette through storms of arrows and flurries  of savage claws without harm.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote and 1 Willpower to activate this Charm. For the rest of the  scene, all attacks the Sidereal attempts to Dodge subtract one success from their total rolled.  Additionally, the Sidereal’s Dodge value may be calculated as (5 + Performance). If this would  raise her Defense above 9, her attackers are forced to discard another success from attacks she  attempts to Dodge."
Sidereal,Serenity,Duck Fate ,3,1,,Athletics,"The Sidereal senses danger approaching in the weave of destiny, and viciously twists its threads  aside to deflect whatever this misfortune might be.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower and roll Dexterity + Athletics against difficulty  8. If successful, the Sidereal perfectly avoids any damaging, deleterious, or unwanted effect  aimed against her. This could be a physical attack, a spirit attempting to possess her, a Solar  talking her into abandoning the Bronze Faction, or even being struck down by the curse of a  broken Eclipse Oath. Continuous effects (such as being burned and asphyxiated by a house that’s  burning down with the Sidereal inside of it) need be avoided only once to protect the character  while she remains exposed."
Sidereal,Serenity,Harmonic Completion ,3,1,,Performance,"The Sidereal conjures a cerulean prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Dancer and binds  it across her eyes, whereupon it becomes a band of starmetal and blue jade. Her words sound to  others like the affirmations and truths they have waited all their lives to hear.","Spend 2 Motes to conjure the prayer strip and a turn to bind it. The Sidereal is  genuinely blind, and suffers appropriate penalties (see p. XX). The Sidereal may re-roll each  failed die in any social influence roll she makes for the rest of the scene. Inspire rolls to make  others form an Intimacy of love for her (romantic or platonic) are made against difficulty 3. All  rolls to attack the Sidereal subtract her Performance rating from their dice pools, but if she lashes  out in violence herself, her blindfold shatters, inflicting one level of unsoakable lethal damage,  and the Charm ends."
Sidereal,Serenity,Lover’s Oath ,3,1,,"Empathy,Linguistics","The Sidereal winds a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Bride around herself and  another consenting character’s fingers. It splits and hardens into a pair of starmetal rings, binding  the fate of the two characters together.","Spend 5 Motes, 1 Willpower. The two bound characters may reflexively banish some or  all of the damage they suffer to their partner’s health track in the moment they are wounded.  Both characters must understand the ramifications of the ritual for it to be effective. Neither can  directly or indirectly attempt to move the rings once they are created, though other characters can  destroy the rings with a carefully-placed blow (a difficulty 8 action), ending the Charm’s effects.
Venus considers this Charm to be tantamount to a wedding ceremony, and frowns on its casual  exploitation or callous misuse. Still, such things are possible for characters willing to deal with  the fallout upon their return to Yu-Shan. The Sidereal needs not have any sort of emotional tie  whatsoever to her partner. Only one bond created by this Charm can exist at a time."
Sidereal,Serenity,Perfection in Life ,3,1,,Performance,"The dance of Venus is the dance of completed patterns, whole fates, and perfection in life: the  realization of all that those who witness it might be, and strive to be, bringing temporary peace  and affirmation to the most broken heart. This Charm imbues the Sidereal’s words and actions  with the cadence of that most sacred of dances, even though outwardly she may be doing no  more than chatting at a café or cooking dinner for her friends.","Spend 2 Motes and roll Charisma + Performance (difficulty 6). If successful, then for  the rest of the scene the Sidereal grants 1 Willpower point to herself and everyone she interacts  with, so long as this wouldn’t raise their current Willpower above either their maximum, or the  number of successes she rolled to activate Perfection in Life. A character can’t benefit from  Perfection in Life more than once per day. Antagonists increase their Resolve by one for the rest  of the scene."
Sidereal,Serenity,You and Yours Stance ,3,1,,Socialize,"The Sidereal entangles herself in every thread of fate which gives rise to lust and desire. She  becomes impossible to recognize: those who behold her see only that which their heart most  fervently desires, and know that to harm or deny her is to shatter their own heart.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, anyone who wishes to harm or  deny the Sidereal must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 8) each time they attempt to do so.
Failure makes such effrontery unthinkable. She lowers the difficulty of all seduction rolls by two."
Sidereal,Serenity,Wanting and Fearing Prayer ,3,1,,Socialize,"The Sidereal holds up two prayer strips marked with the Scripture of the Whore. One by one, she  names their targets, and they vanish, reappearing wrapped around one of their target’s bones.  They burn with cold blue light which cannot shine through flesh, but glows brilliantly if that  flesh is ever cut away. The power of the two prayer strips rewrites destiny to impose a new  relationship on the two characters according to the Sidereal’s dictates.","Spend 6 Motes and make a contested Manipulation + Socialize roll against the Resolve  of each target (difficulty 6). The targets must both be within 10 miles of the Sidereal. If the  Sidereal beats both targets, then she dictates a new social and emotional relationship between the  two of them. As quickly as can be plausibly arranged, destiny moves the characters into this  relationship. This is partly a work of circumstances and partially a work of magical influence; as  such, its effects can be resisted for a scene by citing an Intimacy (or a character’s Nature) that the  Charm is forcing them to act against, and spending a point of Willpower. If Willpower equal to  the Sidereal’s Essence rating is spent in this fashion, the power of the Charm breaks.
Otherwise, the only way to be free of the Wanting and Fearing Prayer is to cut out one of the  prayer strips. Doing so requires an extended Dexterity + Medicine roll against difficulty 8, requiring 12 successes, with each roll inflicting one level of unsoakable lethal damage."
Sidereal,Battles,Any Direction Arrow ,1,1,,Archery,The Sidereal’s attacks curve along the vectors and threads of inevitability to find their targets.,The character’s ranged attacks ignore anything less than 100% cover.
Sidereal,Battles,Crimson Palm Counterstrike ,1,1,,"Brawl,Martial Arts","The Sidereal steps into her opponent’s aggressions, shattering first his attack and then his jaw.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote in response to an attack directed at the Sidereal before her  turn, make an attack roll against a difficulty of the attacker’s Defense rating. Each success rolled  subtracts one of the aggressor’s attack roll successes. If this reduces the attack to 0 successes, the  attack is deflected. If the Sidereal then has any successes left over, she strikes her attacker and  applies them as threshold damage. This uses up the Sidereal’s turn for the round unless she  incapacitates her target."
Sidereal,Battles,Five Seasons Approach ,1,1,,Archery,"If the Sidereal’s skill does not suffice to strike her opponent, then she may trust to the world’s  esteem for her. If that does not serve, then to the world’s fear of what she hopes to save it from.  If that too is insufficient, then to the world’s dreams of the glories she seeks to achieve. If all else  fails, there is always luck.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower before making an attack. The attack  automatically hits, no matter how well the opponent defends or how poorly the Exalt rolls; if the  dice indicate that the attack should not strike true, then it hits anyway, with no threshold damage.  Five Seasons Approach can’t strike through a perfect defense such as Heavenly Guardian  Defense, however, nor can it strike a target if there’s simply no way to reach them (such as if  they’re on the other side of a wall, or outside of a weapon’s maximum range)."
Sidereal,Battles,Generalized Ammunition Technique ,1,1,,"Archery,Thrown","Destiny blesses the Sidereal’s ongoing quest to propel objects into her enemies at high speeds,  enabling her to do so in any circumstance.","This Charm grants a number of blessings once the Sidereal reflexively spends 1 Mote to  activate it for the rest of the scene. First, she always has a few more throwing knives, arrows, or  crossbow bolts hidden somewhere on her person or in her immediate surroundings. Second,  when firing a bow, she can use nearly anything as an arrow: a scream, some flames, a sunbeam, a  beehive, an angry squirrel; as long as it’s not too large and unwieldy to fit it to her bow, she can  fire it. Third and finally, if she has no ranged weapon of any sort available, she can use anything  she can pick up as a ranged weapon, even throwing iron-stiff strands of her own hair or shooting  her saliva through a curled fist like a blowgun if nothing else is available."
Sidereal,Battles,Impose Nature ,1,1,,Presence,"The Sidereal taints someone else’s destiny with her Essence, imposing her own nature upon  them.","The Sidereal makes her own personal sign at another character. Spend 1 Mote and roll  Charisma + Presence against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower. The target gains the  Sidereal’s own Nature in addition to his own, as well as the Sidereal’s Intimacies. They may  regain Willpower according to both Natures, and benefit in full from the bestowed Intimacies;  their personality is also, of course, heavily influenced by their new Nature and Intimacies. This  Charm’s effects last for one day per success rolled."
Sidereal,Battles,Opportune Shot ,1,1,,"Archery,War","Spotting a perfect opportunity shining like a diamond among the threads of what might be, the  Sidereal seizes it, allowing her to act before her foes.","The Sidereal may reflexively spend 1 Mote to cut ahead and attack before any of her  opponents for the next (highest of Archery or War, minimum 1) rounds."
Sidereal,Battles,Predestined Triumph Practice ,1,1,,War,"The Sidereal devises a battle plan and weaves it into destiny. If a group of soldiers follows this  plan, fortune in war surely favors them.","Spend 1 Mote and make an Intelligence + War roll against difficulty 6 to bless a group  that is currently fighting under the Sidereal’s direct leadership, or about to go into battle  employing a tactical plan devised or advised by her. A number of times during the battle equal to  the successes rolled (up to a maximum of the Sidereal’s Essence rating), that group may reduce  the difficulty of all its attack rolls for one round by –2."
Sidereal,Battles,Presence in Absence Technique ,1,1,,Presence,"The Sidereal crafts a message or performance and infects someone’s future with it. At some  point the Sidereal specifies, no matter what the target says or does, his words and deeds will  resonate with the Sidereal’s intended meanings and connotations, and he will deliver the Exalt’s  message.","Spend 1 Mote and make a social influence roll, then specify the circumstance when it  will go off — “when this Dragon-Blooded next meets with Mnemon,” let’s say. At that point, the  Sidereal’s social action deploys through the target’s words and deeds; to continue the example,  let’s say the Dragon-Blooded she tagged earlier, upon meeting Mnemon, unknowingly becomes  the vector for a Manipulation + Presence roll to convince Mnemon that the tagged DragonBlooded is plotting to betray and murder her.
A target can only have one instance of this Charm “hanging” on them at a time."
Sidereal,Battles,Water and Fire Legion ,1,1,,Resistance,"The Sidereal may weave protective destinies out of the threads of fate which govern water and  fire, either protecting herself and her allies or binding spirits of those elements as vigilant  protectors.","The Sidereal touches water or flame and spends 1 Mote. If this is all she does, she rolls  Wits + Resistance against difficulty 6. For a number of days equal to the successes rolled, fire  cannot burn or suffocate her; or water cannot drown, crush, boil, sicken, or freeze her. If she is  also touching someone else, then the person she is touching instead gains that benefit.
If the Sidereal touches a water or fire elemental, or a god strongly representing one of those  elements, then she may roll Charisma + Resistance against a difficulty of its Resolve, compelling  it to protect something that she names for one month per success rolled."
Sidereal,Battles,Wearing Red to a Wedding ,1,1,,"Presence,War","The Sidereal wraps herself in a nonchalant skein of desensitized violence. No matter how  alarming her appearance, she seems unthreatening and unworthy of special notice, even if she’s  covered in blood and openly carrying several gory daiklaves. Unless the Sidereal actually attacks  someone, it seems ridiculous to consider her a threat.","This Charm’s effects are permanent, though if she wishes to intimidate someone with  her gruesome demeanor, the Sidereal may make a Willpower roll at difficulty 6 to dismiss its  effects for a scene."
Sidereal,Battles,Demon-Blocking Battle Pattern ,2,1,,War,"The Sidereal devises a plan to confound those whose power originates outside of Creation and  weaves it into destiny. If a group of soldiers follows this plan, then their strength of arms can  prevail even over demons and the dead.","Spend 1 Mote and make an Intelligence + War roll against difficulty 6 to devise an  auspicious battle plan for a group that is currently fighting under the Sidereal’s direct leadership,  or about to go into battle employing a tactical plan devised or advised by her (this roll can enjoy  a maximum number of successes up to the Sidereal’s Essence rating). At any time, any Exalt or  group fighting according to this plan may declare that on their turn, they are “following the  plan.” They may use reflexive movement, but otherwise make no other action; “following the  plan” is their action for the turn. During the next round, all creatures native to or filled with the  power of of the Underworld, Hell, the Wyld, or other strange realms such as Autochthonia  involved in the battle suffer a dice pool penalty to all of their actions equal to (number of  characters who followed the plan) x (successes on the roll to devise the plan). A group counts as  a number of characters equal to its Size. Thus, if the Sidereal herself and a Size 3 group all  followed a two-success plan in the first round of a fight, then on the second round all ghosts,  zombies, and Abyssals on the battlefield would suffer a –8 penalty to their dice pools before the  effect of Charms. This Charm was instrumental in checking the power of those who made the  world during the Divine Revolution."
Sidereal,Battles,Force Decision ,2,1,,"Presence,War","When she beholds someone about to make a choice, the Sidereal reaches out and severs all future  possibilities save the one she desires.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Charisma + Presence against a difficulty of the target character’s  Willpower rating. If the roll is successful, then the target makes his decision as the Sidereal  chooses. The target must be confronted by some manner of clear choice, such as what to order  off of a menu, or whether or not they’ll cheat on their spouse; the Sidereal cannot force someone  goofing around on their phone while waiting for the bus to “decide” to give the Exalt their wallet  unprompted. Protagonists may spend 2 Willpower to resist this Charm. It cannot force someone  to make a choice that is contrary to his Nature."
Sidereal,Battles,Horrific Wreath ,2,1,,"Martial Arts,Brawl","The Sidereal fortifies herself with the Essence of every manner of bane and calamity, every  being’s worst day all rolled into one.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the next (Essence rating) rounds, the Sidereal’s attacks  inflict aggravated damage."
Sidereal,Battles,Many Missiles Bow Technique ,2,1,,Archery,"The Sidereal summons a crimson prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Clay Maiden, which  she quickly twists into a mighty bow, capable of launching anything she draws and fires from it.","The Sidereal spends a turn creating her crimson bow. When she fires the bow, if she  does not fit an arrow to its string, then she may pay 1 Mote to fire a potentiality drawn from the  threads of fate, with results adjudicated by the Storyteller. The fate of fertile fields might cause a  field of wheat to spring up where the arrow lands. The fate of fine glass might produce a nearlyinvisible arrow which cannot be blocked (antagonists suffer a –2 penalty to Defense) unless the  target succeeds at a reflexive Perception + Awareness roll against difficulty 9. The fate of  darkness might allow the Sidereal to fire an arrow into the sky and briefly transform day to night.  The fate of well-being might allow the Sidereal to fire an arrow that heals rather than hurts the  one it strikes. These are fates of only modest potency, and so cannot enact truly dramatic  miracles such as granting Exaltation, bringing the dead back to life, or turning a vast desert into a  verdant forest (though they might crack a rock and draw forth a spring)."
Sidereal,Battles,Meditation on War ,2,1,,"Melee,War","Calm and precision envelops the Sidereal as she manipulates the threads of fate. She learns to let  her pain spill out into the threads of the tapestry of Creation, to be later conveyed to someone  else so that she needs not suffer now.","Whenever the Sidereal reduces the difficulty of a roll with one of her Charms, such as  Excellence of the Starry Vault, she also reduces her current wound penalties by that same  amount."
Sidereal,Battles,Orchestration of Conflict ,2,1,,Survival,"The Sidereal devises and oversees an intensive training regimen for a small group of students in  which she weaves a challenging military conflict from the threads of destiny. Those who come  through the training are vastly empowered by her tutelage, skilled in the arts of battle and tactics.","The Sidereal spends an entire night consulting the stars, and then an entire day weaving  a customized conflict into the fabric of destiny, and spends 5 Motes, 1 Willpower. She must then,  within the next seven days, touch each student she wishes to put through the training, spending 1  Mote per student. Students need not consent to this training or realize they are undergoing it. The  Sidereal may train up to (Essence rating) students at a time. Once she has attached all the  students she wishes to train to the destiny she’s woven, the Charm takes effect.
If used to train antagonists, the Charm unfolds in a largely narrative fashion, usually occurring over the course of a week, at the end of which they may gain a new appropriate Aptitude chosen  from among the following: Archery, combat, hardiness, oratory, rhetoric, strategy, swordsmanship, or tactics. Once every other story, if they are Exalted, they can gain a new  power relating to one of those Aptitudes.
If used to train protagonists, this Charm either occurs during about a week of downtime, or  consumes a session of gameplay, as the group prefers, during which they are drawn into some  challenging military conflict. If they overcome it, then the next time they spend experience, they  may treat up to three of the following as Favored Attributes or Abilities (the Sidereal chooses  which when she devises the regimen): Strength, Charisma, Archery, Brawl, Martial Arts, Melee,  Presence, Resistance, Stealth, and War. This discount applies both to buying Ability dots and to  buying Charms. This Charm cannot provide any benefit again until a protagonist has spent  experience points on something, and only provides a discount for one purchase (so if the player  has enough normal experience points banked to buy an Ability dot, and enough supernal  experience points banked to buy a Charm, she could only apply the discount to one or the other,  not both)."
Sidereal,Battles,Red Haze ,2,1,,Resistance,The Sidereal makes the Inferior Sign of the Shield. A misty haze of crimson-gleaming starlight  protects all things it illuminates from the denizens of Hell and Underworld.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote. A haze of crimson starlight encompasses everything within  three zones of the Sidereal for the rest of the scene. Within this haze, all demons and Unquiet raise the difficulty of all actions by +1. All soak rolls within the blessed area made against such  foes occur at –1 difficulty (friendly antagonists increase their soak against demons and Unquiet  by +1)."
Sidereal,Battles,Shield of Mars ,2,1,,Resistance,"Tangling her destiny with that of her foe, the Sidereal passes on damage that she might have  suffered to the one who sought to inflict it.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower after rolling soak. Each level of damage soaked  is inflicted instead on the Sidereal’s attacker, where it may be soaked in turn."
Sidereal,Battles,Smiling at the Damned ,2,1,,Melee,"In the moment she strikes true, the world turns a lurid red in acknowledgement of the Sidereal’s  murderous intent.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote upon successfully striking an opponent. If the attack’s  damage was bashing, it becomes lethal. The attack increases its base damage by the higher of  (number of Colleges of her Maiden’s House the Sidereal is initiated into) or (number of Colleges  of the House of Mars the Sidereal is initiated into)."
Sidereal,Battles,Someone Else’s Destiny ,2,1,,Resistance,"The Sidereal compresses a drug or poison within her body into a memorandum attached to her  destiny. At some point in the future, she attaches that memo to an attack, and passes the toxin or  drug on to her target.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote to purge the drug or poison. At any point in the future, the  Sidereal may reflexively discharge it through an attack which inflicts at least one level of lethal  or aggravated damage, afflicting her target with the drug or poison."
Sidereal,Battles,Unobstructed Blow ,2,1,,"Brawl,Melee",The Sidereal loops an unbreakable string of Essence between an attack and her opponent. There  can be no other outcome save pain and ruin.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote to enchant an attack, which may be launched by the Sidereal  or by someone else. The attack becomes unblockable (antagonists suffer a –2 penalty to their  Defense) and removes two dice of the target’s soak (or ignores one point of soak for  antagonists)."
Sidereal,Battles,Easily Accepted Proposition Stance ,3,1,,"Brawl,War","In the heat of battle the Sidereal summons a crimson prayer strip marked with the Scripture of  the Drowning Maiden, whispers her proposal to the fortunes of war into it, and then knots it into  her shadow, where it vanishes into the design of destiny. So long as the Sidereal’s request is the  sort of thing that might happen within the course of a battle, it comes to pass: reinforcements  arrive, or a wall collapses to create an escape route, or the character’s decimated allies turn out to  be merely stunned and dazed rather than wounded and dead. The sky won’t tear open and  unleash a horde of spirits upon her foes, though, nor is a comet going to fall from the heavens to  destroy her enemies.","Spend 3 Motes and roll Intelligence + Brawl against the Willpower rating of the most  prominent, dangerous, or highest-ranking enemy on the battlefield. If the roll succeeds, then that  enemy must make a decision: either allow the Sidereal’s dictate to occur, or else stand in  destiny’s path. If they stand in destiny’s path, then they suffer a number of automatic, unsoakable  levels of aggravated damage equal to the successes rolled as the crimson prayer strip appears  upon their forehead and burns away in a welter of crimson Essence."
Sidereal,Battles,Every Direction Arrow ,3,1,,Archery,"The Sidereal fires a flurry of arrows, which vanish along the vectors of fate before reappearing to  simultaneously strike their target from all directions.","This Charm cannot be used in the same round the Sidereal moves. Spend 3 Motes, 1  Willpower, and end the character’s turn. At the end of the round, after all other characters have  acted, make three Archery attacks against a single target."
Sidereal,Battles,Harmony of Blows ,3,1,,"Brawl,Melee","The Sidereal exists in harmony with the battlefield, letting the gleaming crimson lattice of  destiny guide her into auspicious moments and opportunistic blows.","Reflexively spend 2 Motes. The Sidereal may take a second turn after all other  characters have acted, which must be used to launch an attack at a target of her choice. She may  not move on this turn.
Alternately, spend 1 Mote and use the Sidereal’s turn to launch an attack against a battle group.  If successful, it adds (higher of Melee or Martial Arts) successes to its damage roll."
Sidereal,Battles,Impeding the Flow ,3,1,,Melee,A casual flick of the Exalt’s hand momentarily severs the strand of destiny connecting an attack  with the possibility of harming her.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote to force all of the attack rolls a certain character directs at the  Sidereal this round to generate 0 successes. This Charm has no power to protect the Sidereal  against damaging or deleterious effects with no attack roll, such as environmental damage, nor  against attacks which always hit their target such as Accuracy Without Distance. It also cannot  confound unblockable attacks or unexpected attacks."
Sidereal,Battles,Perfection of the Visionary Warrior ,3,1,,Melee,"The Sidereal summons a prayer strip scribed with the Scripture of the Maiden on the Shelf and  affixes it across her eyes, filling them with blood and starlight. Violence becomes a second  nature to her, and her body moves to kill of its own accord.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower. At the end of the round, after all other  characters have acted, roll an extra attack against an opponent of the Sidereal’s choice, picked  when this Charm is first activated. This Charm persists until that target is defeated or escapes the  battlefield. The Sidereal cannot have two instances of Perfection of the Visionary Warrior active  simultaneously; if she wants to direct her extra attacks at a different enemy, she must first deal  with her current destined foe. The prayer strip does not impede the Sidereal’s vision."
Sidereal,Battles,Spirit-Binding Battle Pattern ,3,1,,War,"The Sidereal summons a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Maiden at War and burns  it; only the letters writ upon it survive as drifting smoke. She consecrates an upcoming battle as a  binding act of destiny, which summons and imposes that destiny upon a spirit of her choosing  through the power of those destinies concluded on the red altar of war.","Spend 3 Motes, 1 Willpower, and outline a battle plan for a group fighting under the  Sidereal’s leadership, or about to go into battle employing a tactical plan devised or advised by  her. The Sidereal must also name a spirit of up to Essence 5, which may be a god, ghost,  elemental, or demon, as she chooses. Up to one Sidereal of each of the other four castes can  cosign her prayer strip before burning it; each that does so adds 1 to the maximum Essence rating  of the summoned spirit.
The pool to summon and bind the spirit is rolled in a contest against the spirit’s Essence rating,  both at difficulty 6. The pool begins at 0 dice. One die is added for every Exalt who dies following the Sidereal’s battle plan. Whenever a group loses a point of Size following her plan,  that also adds another die. If a group is destroyed and slaughtered as it tries to flee, the pool gains  dice equal to its Size at the time of the dissolution. Once the Sidereal is satisfied with the pool’s  size, she may roll it.
If she beats the spirit’s successes, the spirit is bound to either complete a single task and then  seek no retribution, or serve the Sidereal loyally for a year and a day and then seek whatever  revenge it may desire. This binding cannot force a spirit to commit suicide or any act tantamount  to it, or to violate its Nature."
Sidereal,Battles,Storm’s Eye Stance ,3,1,,Melee,"The Sidereal conjures a crimson prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the One-Handed  Maiden and casts it into the air above her. The Sidereal’s surroundings darken, and she is  illuminated by the prayer strip which burns like a coal. By the blessings of war, any injury  inflicted upon her is also visited upon her foes.","Reflexively spend 2 Motes and select a number of enemies equal to the Sidereal’s  Essence rating as this Charm’s targets. For the next (1 + Essence rating) rounds, whenever the  Sidereal suffers damage, make a reflexive Essence roll against difficulty 6. Success causes the  same damage to be inflicted on the targeted enemies, which may be soaked as normal."
Sidereal,Secrets,Avoiding the Truth Technique ,1,1,,Lore,"The Sidereal ties threads of fate connected to the most horrible and unthinkable of things to a  statement she knows to be true, making that truth unthinkable. All who hear her speak become  convinced that she is lying.","Spend 1 Mote. All listeners become mortally certain the Sidereal is lying. If they know she is telling the truth (for instance, she says the sky is blue, and they can look up and clearly see  this is so), they can spend 1 Willpower to resist this Charm (antagonists lower their Resolve by 1  for the rest of the story). Otherwise, they will disbelieve the Sidereal even if their own  knowledge and senses argue otherwise."
Sidereal,Secrets,Efficient Secretary Technique ,1,1,,Investigation,"Upon learning this Charm, the Sidereal spits out a small jubilant spider sculpted from emerald  Essence. When asked to do so by the Sidereal, it scurries off along the threads of fate to find and  retrieve some fact, so long as that information is neither generally lost nor actively hidden. Five  seconds later, it whispers its answer in the Exalt’s ear.","The Sidereal rolls Intelligence + Investigation against difficulty 8, or spends 1 Mote to  automatically succeed. When not in use, the spider rests within the Sidereal’s Essence. Examples  of information the spider might retrieve would include the name of a local satrap or carpenter,  but not that of a mysterious masked bandit; how many years ago a widow lost her husband, but  not how many days ago Mnemon met with secret conspirators; the status of the war between  Lookshy and Thorns, but not the two sides’ plans for how to wage the conflict; the temperature  in Nexus, how many cattle a rancher owns, or how many miles must still be traveled before  arriving in Gem along one’s current course; but not the whereabouts of the Scarlet Empress, the  true identity of Walker in Darkness, or which Sidereals are conspiring with Rakan Thulio."
Sidereal,Secrets,Honorable Thief Spirit ,1,1,,Larceny,"To the eyes of any criminal, the Sidereal seems to have the virtues and qualities that best qualify  her for respect and admiration.",The Sidereal lowers the difficulty of all social interactions with criminals and outlaws  by –1.
Sidereal,Secrets,Mark of Exaltation ,1,1,,Occult,The Sidereal’s caste mark glows with an otherworldly light which illuminates dematerialized  beings and renders them tangible while touched by its radiance.,"Roll Perception + Occult against difficulty 7. Success activates this Charm for the rest  of the scene, making all dematerialized beings in the same zone as the Sidereal visible and  tangible. By reflexively spending 1 Mote, she can re-roll all social actions directed at gods,  elementals, demons, or ghosts for the rest of the scene, keeping the better result."
Sidereal,Secrets,The Methodology of Secrets ,1,1,,Lore,"The Sidereal becomes keenly sensitive to manipulation of the forces of destiny, prophecy, time,  and chance, and may strike out such unauthorized alterations.","When the Sidereal encounters another supernatural manipulation of the forces of  destiny (such as a Sidereal Astrology-crafted destiny another Sidereal unleashed, or an ongoing  Getimian Charm), she may reflexively roll Perception + Occult against difficulty 6 to recognize  the manipulation for what it is. Upon recognizing it, she may then spend 1 Mote and make a  contested Essence roll against the effect’s source. If she gains more successes, the destinymanipulating effect is destroyed and the Sidereal gains one point of Paradox. She cannot use the  Methodology of Secrets against her own Sidereal Astrology or Charms."
Sidereal,Secrets,Name Pilfering Practices ,1,1,,Larceny,"Quickly tugging on a string of fate, the Sidereal palms and pockets her target’s name. Not only  does she learn the individual’s true name, but while she holds onto it no one save the Exalt can  think or speak it.",The Sidereal’s target must be within arm’s reach. Roll Dexterity + Larceny against a  difficulty of the target’s Willpower rating. The Sidereal can keep hold of her target’s name for  (Essence rating) days per success.
Sidereal,Secrets,Of Secrets Yet Untold ,1,1,,Lore,"The Sidereal whispers in a hushed exhalation of Old Realm, imparting an ancient secret to an  earth elemental or god of the land, which the spirit may never repeat. In exchange, the spirit must  perform some favor for the Sidereal at a future date. The spirit knows the nature of the service it  must perform, but the Exalt does not.","Spend 2 Motes while interacting with an appropriate spirit. Until the spirit has  discharged its obligation, it must make a Willpower roll at difficulty 8 to initiate any hostile  action against the Sidereal."
Sidereal,Secrets,Research Assistant Invocation ,1,1,,Investigation,"Clapping her hands, the Sidereal causes a plant to grow into the likeness of a helpful scholar and  research assistant.","Spend 1 Mote. The assistant has an Expertise pool of 7 dice, a Utility pool of 2, and  Aptitudes in observation, investigation, academics, and research. It knows whatever languages  the Sidereal does. In dangerous situations, such as combat, it panics and reverts to the form of a plant. Otherwise, it remains a loyal assistant for five days."
Sidereal,Secrets,Subordinate Inspiration Technique ,1,1,,Stealth,"The Sidereal may whisper into the mind of those unaware of her presence, and they hear her  words as their own thoughts.","This Charm has no cost. It is only efficacious if the Sidereal is within one zone of the  target character, and if they in turn aren’t aware she’s present. Usually this means the Sidereal is  hiding by means of stealth, but it can also be used to, for example, whisper into the target’s mind  while disguised as a bird. Her whispers are not audible to others.
The target isn’t forced to act on the thoughts the Sidereal feeds him, but he does believe them to  be his own thoughts."
Sidereal,Secrets,Systematic Understanding of Everything ,1,1,,Lore,"Each night while the Sidereal sleeps, she dreams of what is, what was, and what might be. With  practice, she learns to filter these visions down to a useful few which will guide her when she  wakes.","Each day when the Sidereal awakens, she may assign a bonus dot to one of her  Abilities. This may not raise an Ability above 5."
Sidereal,Secrets,Terrestrial Circle Sorcery ,1,1,,Occult,The Sidereal has been initiated into the practice of sorcery. She can cast Terrestrial Circle spells  and enact sorcerous workings. Purchase of this Charm grants one shaping ritual and one  Terrestrial Circle spell.,See Chapter Eleven for rules on playing a sorcerer.
Sidereal,Secrets,Vibrations in the Spider’s Web ,1,1,,"Awareness,Investigation,Occult","Supernatural beings announce themselves as a trembling in the threads of fate around the  Sidereal. In time, she may even learn to discern the warm vibrations of one of the sun’s Chosen  from the fraying whipsaw motions of a Second Circle demon plowing through destiny’s design.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. For the rest of the scene, the Sidereal becomes aware when  she stands in the presence of any supernatural being, though she doesn’t inherently know what  sort of supernatural being it may be. She can try to puzzle it out by rolling Perception +  (Awareness or Investigation) against difficulty 9, or difficulty 7 if she’s encountered this sort of  being in the past. If she also knows the Methodology of Secrets, then her Vibrations in the  Spider’s Web automatically identifies fate-manipulating supernatural beings without the need of  a roll."
Sidereal,Secrets,Celestial Circle Sorcery ,2,3,,Occult,The Sidereal has been initiated into the mighty workings of the Celestial Circle of sorcery. She  can cast Celestial Circle spells. Purchase of this Charm grants one shaping ritual and one  Celestial Circle spell.,See Chapter Eleven for rules on playing a sorcerer.
Sidereal,Secrets,Creation-Smuggling Procedures ,2,1,,Larceny,The Sidereal entwines herself in the solid and reliable weave of the mundane until it encases her  like armor.,"Whenever the character is the subject of any supernatural power that seeks to transform,  infect, taint, transport, or control her body or spirit, or to alter her destiny or her place in the  world (such as by magically altering her Backgrounds), she may reflexively spend 1 Mote and  roll Wits + Larceny against difficulty 7. Success deflects the hostile magic, protecting the  Sidereal completely, and immunizes her against repeated attempts to exert the same sort of  influence for the rest of the scene."
Sidereal,Secrets,Dream Confiscation Approach ,2,1,,Larceny,"Casually bumping into her target or otherwise making light contact, the Sidereal adroitly pockets  her victim’s dreams.","Upon making physical contact with the target, spend 1 Mote and roll Wits + Larceny  against difficulty 7. Success allows the Sidereal to steal the target’s dreams, and to keep them for  one day per success. This reveals to the Sidereal the target’s Nature, his greatest aspiration, and  his greatest fear. While a target’s dreams are missing, he cannot regain Willpower from rest, fulfilling his Nature, or from promoting any Intimacy related to a grand ambition; and he feels  listless and incomplete. The Sidereal can ransom a target’s dreams back before this Charm  concludes, if she wishes; the target doesn’t inherently know that there’s a time-limit on the  Sidereal’s custody of his dreams.
If used against one of the Fair Folk, this Charm inflicts aggravated damage equal to the successes  rolled."
Sidereal,Secrets,Embracing Life Method ,2,1,,Investigation,"The Sidereal plucks a prayer strip from the air bearing the Scripture of That Old Thing.  Impressing a question or curiosity upon it, she buries the prayer strip as though it were a seed.  Over the course of the next five days, it sets down roots and grows into a small mulberry tree.  Spirits of wood are drawn to visit it and leave beneath its branches small gifts and useful secrets.","Spend 4 Motes, 1 Willpower, and roll Charisma + Investigation against difficulty 8.  After five days, the Sidereal may return to harvest the tree’s bounty. For each success rolled, she  finds one gift and one bit of information useful in resolving her question or satisfying her  curiosity. Gifts are generally small trinkets she will find interesting or pleasant, but may  occasionally be truly useful objects. The spirits also generally leave a fair amount of useless  gossip and gaudy baubles."
Sidereal,Secrets,Marvelous Inclusion of Details ,2,1,,"Investigation,Lore","The Sidereal devises and oversees an intensive training regimen for a small group of students in  which she weaves a mystery into the skein of destiny. Those who come through the training are  vastly empowered by her tutelage, wise in the ways of enigmas.","The Sidereal spends an entire night consulting the stars, and then an entire day weaving  a customized mystery into the fabric of destiny, and spends 5 Motes, 1 Willpower. She must  then, within the next seven days, touch each student she wishes to put through the training,  spending 1 Mote per student. Students need not consent to this training or realize they are  undergoing it. The Sidereal may train up to (Essence rating) students at a time. Once she has  attached all the students she wishes to train to the destiny she’s woven, the Charm takes effect.
If used to train antagonists, the Charm unfolds in a largely narrative fashion, usually occurring over the course of a week, at the end of which they may gain a new appropriate Aptitude chosen  from among the following: Academics, crime, empathy, investigation, mysticism, observation, or  stealth. Once every other story, if they are Exalted, they can gain a new power relating to one of  those Aptitudes.
If used to train protagonists, this Charm either occurs during about a week of downtime, or  consumes a session of gameplay, as the group prefers, during which they are drawn into some  challenging military conflict. If they overcome it, then the next time they spend experience, they  may treat up to three of the following as Favored Attributes or Abilities (the Sidereal chooses  which when she devises the regimen): Intelligence, Wits, Awareness, Empathy, Investigation,  Larceny, Lore, Martial Arts, Occult, and Stealth. This discount applies both to buying Ability  dots and to buying Charms. This Charm cannot provide any benefit again until a protagonist has  spent experience points on something, and only provides a discount for one purchase (so if the  player has enough normal experience points banked to buy an Ability dot, and enough supernal  experience points banked to buy a Charm, she could only apply the discount to one or the other,  not both)."
Sidereal,Secrets,Of the Shape of the World ,2,1,,Larceny,"Averting her eyes from a truth that is, the Sidereal creates a truth that she wishes to see, and  weaves it into the flow of history.",The Sidereal may spend 1 Mote to lower the difficulty of a Sidereal Astrology effect  roll by –2.
Sidereal,Secrets,Sidereal Shell Games ,2,1,,Larceny,"The Sidereal calls the weave of events to hand, then deftly crosses her wrists and steals power  from another.","Select a target within line of sight, then reflexively spend 1 Mote and roll Wits +  Larceny against a difficulty of their Willpower. For each success, the Sidereal can steal one point  of one of the following values from the target and add it to her own for the rest of the scene: soak  dice, damage dice, or dice from a specific pool (such as Dexterity + Archery). Only one instance  of this Charm can be active at a time. If targeting an antagonist, it takes two successes to steal a  point of base damage or soak (which grants the Sidereal +2 base damage or soak), and dice must  be stolen from specific Aptitudes. Only one instance of this Charm can be active at a time, and  she cannot increase her rating by more than (Essence) dice."
Sidereal,Secrets,Tell-Tale Symphony ,2,1,,Occult,"Magic announces itself in the Sidereal’s presence as a series of chimes and tones that only she  can hear. With some practice, she can even learn to differentiate the sound of a sorcerous  working from an activated Solar Charm.","The Sidereal can roll Perception + Occult against difficulty 7 to survey the Essence of  the world around her. Depending on the number of successes rolled and the presence of anything  interesting to detect, she might uncover things like the radiance of a nearby Manse or Demesne, a  subtle but active spell or sorcerous working, or the fact that a ferocious amount of Essence was  spent in the area sometime recently. She can also discern particular tones and depths of Essence  if she has encountered them before, and thus might use this Charm to track a missing Circlemate  by the resonance of his passing."
Sidereal,Secrets,Transcendent Hatchet of Fate ,2,1,,Lore,"The Sidereal draws forth a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Maiden in Terror, then  watches it sink into her palm in a sickly hissing of green light, where it lurks as a portent of  terrible certainty. Later, she shows her palm to a chosen victim, and there he glimpses the  certainty of the future he most fears.","Spend 3 Motes. Upon showing her palm to someone, the Charm discharges. The  Sidereal names a hideous fate which she realizes will befall the target, and he knows it to be true.
Roll Intelligence + Lore against difficulty 9. The target loses a number of points of Willpower  equal to the successes rolled; antagonists lower their Resolve by that value for the rest of the  story.
While out-of-character, the Sidereal’s player names her target’s doom (subject to the Storyteller  affirming that the doom is possible), within the fiction of the world the Sidereal simply names a foreordained doom that she has no authorship over herself. This Charm freezes the target’s  agency over his own destiny, so that his own efforts cannot save him from causality’s funnel  toward this monstrous ending, but the actions of others can still turn the world from its course  and rescue him from this awful conclusion."
Sidereal,Secrets,Blinding the Boar ,3,1,,Stealth,"The Sidereal enwraps herself in the interstice of a thousand potential futures, obscuring the truth  of her existence. Though she remains clearly visible to all senses, it’s impossible to pick out any  of her features, understand what she’s saying, or tell precisely what she’s doing.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote and roll Manipulation + Stealth against difficulty 6. For one  round per success, the Sidereal’s existence is blurred, and any attempts to attack her or restrain  her, raise their difficulty by +2. If this would raise the difficulty above 9, attackers lose one  success from their rolls."
Sidereal,Secrets,Ceasing to Exist Approach ,3,1,,Stealth,"The Sidereal summons an emerald prayer strip marked with the Scripture of Absence, affixes it  to her chest, and ceases to exist. She becomes a different person of her own devising, existing  somewhere in the world. She reappears somewhere else, having become that new person,  complete with a home, relationships, possessions, and a history to support her new existence.","Spend 5 Motes. The Sidereal vanishes and ceases to exist, and while she does not exist,  no magic can identify her if it targets her through her identity rather than physical location.
The Sidereal’s new life may be any manner of being: mortal, Exalt, ghost, or even a god or beast.  She is transported through the weave of destiny to a place appropriate to begin her new  existence. She has 15 dots of Backgrounds supporting her new life. Those around her develop  memories and relationships to support the legitimacy of her existence. Thus, if she became an  Abyssal serving the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears, the living and dead of the shadowland  where she appears would recognize her and remember her; if she took the Allies Background,  other deathknights would view her as a boon companion; and so forth. The Lover, in theory,  would recognize her as a servant as well, but approaching her would be risky, as she is certainly  a sufficiently potent supernatural being to possess defenses against having her perceptions and  memories toyed with. The specifics of panoply-type Backgrounds are chosen by the Storyteller  rather than the Sidereal. She may choose to bedeck herself with potent artifacts, but destiny  decides which artifacts she manifests.
The Sidereal gains no new powers or abilities from her new life, but her existing Sidereal powers  disguise themselves as whatever sort of powers the kind of being the Sidereal pretends to be  ought to have. Those around her will ignore any inconsistencies in the Sidereal’s existence if she  offers up at least a flimsy excuse. Finally, the Sidereal’s Arcane Fate doesn’t obscure her new  identity.
The Sidereal may end this Charm at any time, and it automatically terminates if her anima flares or after five days. When this Charm ends, the Sidereal is plucked out of her false life and  returned back to a place appropriate for her true identity. Any panoply-type Backgrounds she  conjured as part of her identity’s cover story are subsumed back into the fabric of destiny."
Sidereal,Secrets,Conning Chaos Technique ,3,1,,Larceny,"The Sidereal conjures forth a prayer strip scribed with the Scripture of the Savory Maiden and  nails it to the air, where it periodically sheds a green light, then names a victim. The victim  briefly glimpses the prayer strip as the Sidereal trades his destiny to the Wyld in exchange for a  portion of Creation ceded back from the grip of chaos.","Name a target within 10 miles, reflexively spend 3 Motes, 1 Willpower, and roll  Manipulation + Larceny against difficulty 9. This Charm places a curse upon its victim for one  month per success. He is constantly considered to occupy the bordermarches of the Wyld, whose  effects can only intrude upon his own person, potentially twisting his mind or body. Fair Folk  and other denizens of the Wyld instinctively recognize the target as having been marked for  destruction by the grand processes of the Wyld, and are considered to be in the Wyld while  working mischief or aggression upon him.
Once per month, the victim may make an Intelligence + Lore roll against difficulty 8 to research  his curse, discovering particulars of its nature. One success causes him to realize that destroying  the prayer strip he glimpsed at the beginning of his curse will free him; three successes leads him  to realize that it was somewhere within 10 miles of his location when he saw it; and five  successes tells him exactly where it is.
Once the curse expires or the Wyld destroys its victim, the deep processes of chaos dimly realize  that they have been cheated; that Creation has gained more from this exchange than chaos has.  The dreams of the tribes of madness henceforth feature the Sidereal as a great enemy, with  increasing frequency and urgency the more often she uses this Charm."
Sidereal,Secrets,Of Horrors Best Unknown ,3,1,,Lore,"The Sidereal draws a net of Essence from within the weave of destiny, its strands thinner than the  space between a man and his shadow. That which the Sidereal casts the net across becomes  entangled in the skein of destiny, condemning it to a terrible misfortune of the Sidereal’s  devising.","Spend 2 Motes and roll Dexterity + Athletics against a difficulty of its target’s Defense  to cast the net. If it entangles its target — and the net is capable of snaring even ghosts and  similarly dematerialized beings — then the Sidereal may name a certain circumstance or criteria,  such as “so long as you continue to haunt this family” or “whenever you engage in battle.”  Whenever that circumstance applies, all dice pools to oppose the target lower their difficulty by  one, save for damage and soak rolls. This Charm’s effects last for the Sidereal’s Essence rating  in weeks."
Sidereal,Secrets,Of Things Desired and Feared ,3,1,,Lore,"This terrible Charm allows the Sidereal to burn a calcified path of certainty across the course of  destiny, forging many threads of causality into a blade that severs all other possibility—and  usually slashes the hands of the one wielding it.","The character spends 5 Motes, 1 Willpower and three hours in meditation, sending her  thoughts into the utmost depths of time and causality. She names a goal, and asks destiny by  what means she might achieve it. In response, she sees a clear course to victory and learns its  price, which might be anything from “a few bumps and bruises” to “the destruction of yourself,  of your Circle, of your legacy, of everything you hold dear, of everything that you see as good  and worth fighting for in the world, and more besides.” If the Sidereal chooses to pay this price, she automatically achieves her goal and suffers the  consequences of her choice; it is narratively resolved amidst the workings of other stories.
The path laid out by this Charm’s prophecies is rarely optimal. It is often possible that the  Sidereal might have triumphed at significantly less cost by relying upon her own efforts and  risking uncertainty. Used to resolve minor matters, this Charm’s costs are usually inconvenient.  Used to resolve the central struggles of a chronicle or an age, they are horrifyingly ruinous.
This Charm does have one substantial flaw: The Methodology of Secrets may sever its  certainties. Several Sidereals may band together to enact Of Things Desired and Feared in unison  to add together their Essence ratings as a form of insurance against such meddling, if they agree  to do so."
Sidereal,Secrets,Of Truths Best Unspoken ,3,1,,Lore,"Settling into meditation, the Sidereal casts her Essence deep into the annals of time and causality,  letting her awareness wind deep, deep, deep into the darkest tangles of destiny’s weave, in search  of those secrets the future knows but fears to acknowledge.","The character spends 5 Motes and three hours in meditation, casting through the threads  of the future for knowledge she seeks. She may make one Intelligence + Lore roll (difficulty 6)  to uncover some knowledge she desires as though consulting a comprehensive history of the  world penned on the last night of the Second Age. For example, seeking to intuit the Mask of  Winters’s next move, a Sidereal “researches” moments in the future where he is destined to  openly act. Five successes might lead tell her exactly what he’s planning (to decimate Lookshy  with millions of man-sized, flesh-eating flies hatched from the rotting hulk of Juggernaut), while  one would merely reveal that it has something to do with the great aurochs-sized maggots  feasting on the eternally rotting carcass of Juggernaut.
Use of this Charm deeply tangles the threads of destiny, and the Sidereal can employ it no more  than once per story."
Sidereal,Secrets,Walking Outside Fate ,3,1,,Stealth,"The Sidereal steps outside of the remit of causality altogether. She moves stealthily through the  world, not wholly a part of it. She may hide in the space between moments, the gap between a dog and its howl, the point where a man and his shadow are joined.","The character gains 1 Paradox. She cannot be tracked without perfect supernatural  means, nor detected by the senses of others who do not possess utterly flawless acuity. If she  attempts to interact with something inside of fate, such as by stealing an object, those nearby  may roll Perception + Awareness against difficulty 9; two successes allows them to glimpse the  Sidereal for the rest of the scene. Should she enact violence or flare her anima, this Charm ends;  otherwise, the Sidereal may walk outside of fate until she reflexively chooses to end this Charm."
Sidereal,Endings,Death-Parrying Stroke ,1,1,,Martial Arts,"In the last possible moment, the Sidereal interposes mere steel between herself and the end of her  life.","Once per scene, if an enemy’s deliberate attack would leave the Sidereal incapacitated,  it instead inflicts no damage."
Sidereal,Endings,Forgotten Earth ,1,1,,Athletics,The Sidereal momentarily severs the connection between herself and the ground.,"The Sidereal’s jumping distance and height is doubled. By reflexively spending 1 Mote,  the Sidereal may increase her jumping distance or height fivefold. In combat, she can easily  relocate to zones above her without recourse to complex movement."
Sidereal,Endings,Fortuitous Announcement ,1,1,,Occult,"Upon making some grand prediction or announcement, the Sidereal makes a dramatic gesture,  chopping through those threads of fate that enable doubt in her predictions.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote. Causality promptly produces some manner of highlyconvincing omen such as a flock of screaming raitons, an ominous crash of thunder, or a random  bystander being struck blind or cured or blindness to underscore the credibility of the Sidereal’s  pronouncement. The omen is always in line with the declaration; if she declares that a certain  course of action is inauspicious, some dire fate befalls the first person to doubt her. If she  declares that it is timely to depart, then the clouds part and a row of sunbeams illuminate the  road."
Sidereal,Endings,Hungry Touch ,1,1,,"Athletics,Craft","The Sidereal touches an object and abridges its destiny, bringing about its conclusion.","The character touches an object no larger than a wagon, spends 1 Mote, and rolls  Intelligence + (Athletics or Craft) against difficulty 7. Success causes the object to age by years  or decades in a matter of moments. The Sidereal chooses how much or how little time ravages  the object. If she accumulates at least three successes, even very sturdy and enduring objects  such as a steel vault door may be rotted into nothing more than dust or flakes of rust."
Sidereal,Endings,Inexorable Advance ,1,1,,Athletics,"Eliding the moments of her own life between footsteps, the Sidereal may move without motion.","The Sidereal concentrates for a turn, then rolls Wits + Athletics against difficulty 6.  Success lets her instantly move up to one zone per success. This isn’t teleportation per se; the  Sidereal “merely” omits all of the moments between the beginning and end of her movement. As  a result, she can go anywhere she could have reached through normal movement given sufficient  time, but cannot, for example, blink from the inside of a prison cell to the hallway outside."
Sidereal,Endings,Peaceable Conclusion ,1,1,,Medicine,The Sidereal may sever those unnatural ties that allow death and life to commingle.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote upon striking an animated corpse and roll the Sidereal’s Essence against its Essence rating, both at difficulty 6. If the Sidereal’s successes equal or  exceed those of the target, whatever force animates it ceases to have any power to do so. A  possessing nemissary is forced from its body, while the magic that animates a spine chain or  zombie loses all potency. If used against a group of walking dead, this Charm causes the  underlying attack to inflict aggravated damage."
Sidereal,Endings,Precedent-Summoning Feit ,1,1,,Bureaucracy,"While arguing a legal or other technical point, the Sidereal reaches into the pages of history and  draws forth a precedent that supports her position. It may be very old, and it may be very  obscure, but it is inevitably genuine and lends credence to her efforts.","The Sidereal may re-roll any failed Bureaucracy, Lore, or Socialize roll, so long as that  roll is an attempt to take action (as opposed to looking up information in a library)."
Sidereal,Endings,Prior Warning ,1,1,,Awareness,"The Sidereal’s awareness constantly probes the near future, warning her of impending danger.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Perception + Awareness against difficulty 6. This Charm lasts a  number of hours equal to the Sidereal’s Essence rating. For each success rolled, she gets one  minute of advance warning when she is about to be in danger, as well as an awareness of the  nature of the danger (“In three minutes, a demon is going to leap off of a roof and attempt to bite  your throat out.”). If no successes are rolled, the warning comes only a turn in advance."
Sidereal,Endings,Smooth Transition ,1,1,,Medicine,"With but a gentle touch, the Sidereal enables a peaceful and painless transition between life and  death.","Spend 1 Mote while touching the Charm’s subject. The Charm instantly and painlessly  kills any Incapacitated or dying target, as well as anyone who wishes to die. If used on a corpse  laying upon the naked ground, it sinks into the earth, quietly arranging for its own burial. No one  slain by this Charm ever lingers as a ghost."
Sidereal,Endings,Terminate Illness ,1,1,,Medicine,"The Sidereal makes the Lesser Sign of the Corpse against the spirit of an illness, bringing that  disease to an end.",Spend 1 Mote. The Sidereal’s target is immediately cured of one disease or sickness.
Sidereal,Endings,Wise Choice ,1,1,,Awareness,"When confronted by many choices, the Sidereal may evaluate the future to learn which is most  immediately beneficial.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote to learn which of an array of options will lead to the best  short-term outcome. This Charm only evaluates the immediate future, not long-term or  cumulative repercussions; for example, a Sidereal who uses it to win every game of chance in a  casino is likely to be quickly kicked out of the building as the management comes to suspect her  of cheating."
Sidereal,Endings,Blade of the Violet Bier ,2,1,,Martial Arts,The Sidereal cuts away the swift conclusion of her empowering by the workings of destiny.,"Reflexively spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower. When the Sidereal uses Excellence of the  Starry Vault to add dice to an Ability, she adds dice to it for the rest of the scene rather than (1 +  Essence rating) rounds."
Sidereal,Endings,Burn Life ,2,1,,Athletics,The Sidereal burns hours from the ordained duration of her life to suffuse herself with short-term  power.,The difficulty of feats of strength to lift or break something are lowered by –3. The  Sidereal may reflexively spend 1 Mote to cause her unarmed attacks to gain a base damage of 7B  for the rest of the scene and to cause her soak rolls to ignore the rule of 1s.
Sidereal,Endings,Conclusive Wisdom ,2,1,,"Awareness,Stealth","The Sidereal protects herself with a shroud of inevitability to which she is quite accustomed, but  which other beings shudder to confront. Whenever someone tries to supernaturally glean the  Sidereal’s secrets, such as by reading her mind or forecasting her future, they instead see only a  prayer strip floating in the darkness before their eyes, which slowly blooms with pungent violet  flowers, which in turn unfold into a terrible vision of the spy’s ultimate demise.","The Sidereal may reflexively pay 1 Mote when she is subjected to scrying, mindreading, soul scrutiny, and similar magic, and make a Wits + Awareness roll against a difficulty  of the scrutinizer’s Willpower rating. The spy is blocked from learning anything about the  Sidereal, and loses one point of Willpower per success rolled (or lowers their Resolve for the rest  of the current story), as the prophecy of their final destruction shakes them to their core. Worse,  as the vision-petals wilt and fall away, so too do all details of their foreseen death, leaving  behind only a terrible feeling of hopelessness, but no details with which to work to avert it."
Sidereal,Endings,End Debate ,2,1,,Bureaucracy,"The Sidereal calls forth a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Maiden’s Promise and  casts it to the ground, where it explodes in a burst of amethyst light. Silence falls in its wake as  those who witness the eruption realizes that all has already been said, and that it is time for  action.","Spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower. This Charm instantly ends a debate, bringing it to whatever  its natural conclusion would have been; the participants proceed to a vote or drop the matter as  causality dictates. Alternately, this Charm may stop a bureaucratic process cold, severing all  futures in which it moves forward so much as a single bit for the rest of the current story."
Sidereal,Endings,Expected Pain ,2,1,,Awareness,"The Sidereal becomes acutely attuned to one form of misery, the better to safeguard herself  against it.","Name one variety of misfortune upon learning this Charm, such as “being attacked,” “being betrayed,” “being poisoned,” “suffering the death of a loved one,” or “being humiliated.” Whenever this misfortune is about to befall the Sidereal, she becomes supernaturally aware of  the fact with just enough time to prevent its occurrence by swift and decisive action — assuming  she can immediately figure out what that action ought to be."
Sidereal,Endings,Metal Storm ,2,1,,"Martial Arts,Melee","The Sidereal folds together memory, prophecy, and effort to strike a threefold blow against her  enemy.","Upon attacking and damaging a foe with a Martial Arts or Melee attack, the Sidereal sets up a destined repetition. If she successfully strikes the same foe on her next turn, reduce the  difficulty of the damage roll by one. If she does so again on the round after, reduce the difficulty  of the damage roll by two. This sequence resets after three attacks."
Sidereal,Endings,Icy Hand ,2,1,,Bureaucracy,"The Sidereal crystallizes a narrow array of possible futures as she touches an officer of a  bureaucracy or similarly formal organization, making it impossible for them to succumb to  corruption or graft in the course of their duties.","Touch the target, spend 1 Mote, and roll Charisma + Bureaucracy against a difficulty of  their Willpower rating. They are compelled to perform their duties honestly for one day per  success rolled."
Sidereal,Endings,Invocation of the Storm-Following Silence ,2,1,,"Medicine,Occult",The Sidereal may use death as a doorway to pass into the Underworld.,"So long as the Sidereal is in the presence of a dead body, a grave, a memorial marker, a  funeral procession, or some other worldly reminder of death, she may pay 1 Mote and roll Wits +  Medicine against difficulty 7 to slip into the Underworld. Since the entire Underworld is a place  of death, she can use this Charm anywhere in the Underworld to cross back into the land of the  living. When she crosses over, she can bring as many willing passengers along with her as she  pleases, so long as they’re wearing mourning clothes, paying respects to the departed, weeping  inconsolably, or otherwise making overt acknowledgement of death."
Sidereal,Endings,Sorrowful Conclusion ,2,1,,Empathy,"The Sidereal devises and oversees an intensive training regimen for a small group of students in  which she weaves a terrible crisis into the fabric of destiny. Those who come through the  training are vastly empowered by her tutelage, hardened by the need to pursue decisive action  and rise to terrible necessity.","The Sidereal spends an entire night consulting the stars, and then an entire day weaving  a crisis which must be promptly concluded into the fabric of destiny, and spends 5 Motes, 1  Willpower. She must then, within the next seven days, touch each student she wishes to put  through the training, spending 1 Mote per student. Students need not consent to this training or  realize they are undergoing it. The Sidereal may train up to (Essence rating) students at a time.
Once she has attached all the students she wishes to train to the destiny she’s woven, the Charm  takes effect.
If used to train antagonists, the Charm unfolds in a largely narrative fashion, usually occurring over the course of a week, at the end of which they may gain a new appropriate Aptitude chosen  from among the following: Athletic displays, bureaucracy, keen senses, empathy, martial arts,  medicine, or mysticism. Once every other story, if they are Exalted, they can gain a new power relating to one of those Aptitudes.
If used to train protagonists, this Charm either occurs during about a week of downtime, or  consumes a session of gameplay, as the group prefers, during which they are drawn into some  challenging survival ordeal. If they overcome it, then the next time they spend experience, they  may treat up to three of the following as Favored Attributes or Abilities (the Sidereal chooses  which when she devises the regimen): Dexterity, Intelligence, Athletics, Awareness,  Bureaucracy, Empathy, Martial Arts, Medicine, Occult, and Stealth. This discount applies both  to buying Ability dots and to buying Charms. This Charm cannot provide any benefit again until  a protagonist has spent experience points on something, and only provides a discount for one  purchase (so if the player has enough normal experience points banked to buy an Ability dot, and  enough supernal experience points banked to buy a Charm, she could only apply the discount to  one or the other, not both)."
Sidereal,Endings,Underling Invisibility Practice ,2,1,,Stealth,"It is the will of destiny that those who consider themselves above the process of fate shall  become most vulnerable to it. The Sidereal wraps her destiny in threads of humble obscurity,  making herself completely imperceptible to anyone who considers himself superior to the  Sidereal, be it morally, personally, or hierarchically. They cannot even perceive the efforts of  others to point out the Sidereal’s presence or existence.","Spend 1 Mote to enjoy this Charm’s effects for a scene. Its benefits cease to hide the  Sidereal from someone if she physically interacts with them, and the Charm collapses altogether  if her anima flares."
Sidereal,Endings,Conclusion-Pursuing Approach ,3,1,,Martial Arts,"The Sidereal conjures forth a prayer strip scribed with the Scripture of the Expectant Maiden and  affixes it to her weapon or fist, imbuing it with lethal power.","Spend 1 Mote and a turn affixing the prayer strip. For the rest of the scene, the  enchanted weapon is unbreakable and all successful attacks made with it increase their final  damage by one after soak. This cannot cause the weapon to inflict damage if it would have  otherwise inflicted 0 damage."
Sidereal,Endings,Earth and Sky Bargain ,3,1,,"Medicine,Occult","The Sidereal summons a violet prayer strip inscribed with the Scripture of the Maiden and the  Road and buries it in the earth. An intuition steals over her, and leads her to a spirit of the earth  or air that is, for whatever reason, on the verge of death. The Sidereal may offer it a bargain: bind  itself to her for a time, and survive.","Spend 3 Motes and roll Perception + (Medicine or Occult) against difficulty 9. Success  will lead the Sidereal to an appropriate spirit. While the spirit is bound to her, she regenerates all  levels of bashing damage or one level of lethal damage per hour, and adds three dice to her soak  rolls. She can transfer the spirit to someone else if she desires, granting them its benefits,  although she has no power to reclaim it. The spirit remains bound to service for one day per  success rolled, after which it springs free, restored to its ordinary state of health. It may or may  not feel indebted to the Sidereal, depending on how long it was bound and whether or not she  had anything to do with its being on death’s doorstep in the first place."
Sidereal,Endings,Inevitable Pursuit ,3,1,,"Awareness,Survival","The character’s quarry can no more hide from her than from his own past. The Sidereal tracks  her prey, not based on the physical signs of his passing, but on the impressions he leaves on the  fate of the world and those he comes in contact with.","Once the character finds some evidence of a trail to follow, her player may spend 1  Mote to perfectly track the target for the next 24 hours. No roll is needed."
Sidereal,Endings,Invisible Motion ,3,1,,Athletics,"The Sidereal summons a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Maiden and the Dust, and  wraps it around her neck or forehead. She now skips over the trivial moments of her life, moving  like a flipbook drawing with pages stuck together, blinking from place to place and motion to  motion.","Spend 1 Mote, 1 Willpower. For the rest of the scene, the Sidereal may move two zones  rather than one when she moves on every other turn. Moreover, her armor has no mobility  penalty and no fatigue value."
Sidereal,Endings,Life-Severing Blow ,3,1,,"Martial Arts,Melee","The Sidereal winds the inevitability of death into her blows, ensuring that they strike mortal  wounds into her enemies.","Reflexively spend 1 Mote and roll Willpower against difficulty 7. For each success, the  Sidereal may enhance one attack she makes during the current scene, allowing that attack’s  damage roll to be made at –2 difficulty. She assigns this enhancement immediately before rolling  her damage dice, so that it is never wasted upon failed attacks.
Life-Severing Blow can only be activated once per scene."
Sidereal,Endings,Terminal Sanction ,3,1,,"Bureaucracy,Occult","The Sidereal calls upon an ancient sanction granting her the authority of Heaven to call even the  gods themselves to answer her audit, and to destroy them if found wanting.","Target a spirit in the same zone as the Sidereal, then spend 2 Motes and roll Intelligence + Bureaucracy against a difficulty of (3 + the target’s Essence rating). If the target is in  dematerialized, it immediately manifests at no cost for the rest of the scene whether or not the  Sidereal’s roll succeeded. If the roll succeeded, then the Sidereal gains Terminal Sanction over  the spirit. If she destroys it during the current scene, then she has the following options: She can  obliterate the being utterly and permanently, suspend its destruction and imprison it within an  object, suspend its destruction and demand it perform a single task, or suspend its destruction  and instead compel its service for a year and a day."
Sidereal,Endings,Supernal Awareness ,3,1,,Awareness,"The Sidereal filters her awareness of the complex weave of destiny as the present cascades into  the future around her. She may sweep the weave of fate for specific disturbances, denoting  individuals or phenomena she wishes to locate.","Spend 1 Mote and roll Perception + Awareness against difficulty 6. The Sidereal’s  supernal sense extends out to thirty zones per success rolled — five successes will give her a  detection range of about a mile. The Sidereal sets this sense to sweep for the presence of  whatever she specifies: ghosts, Solars, warding spells, Demesnes, daiklaves, corpses, murder  scenes. If there’s anything to detect, then the Sidereal gains a vague sense of what direction she  should head in to locate the thing she seeks, although this Charm’s of no further use once she  arrives at her destination. She might know, upon arriving at a teahouse, that there is a Solar somewhere inside, but that doesn’t tell her which person in the teahouse is the Solar… or even if  there might be more than one Solar present.
Paradox Missions So, from time to time, Sidereals receive missions from Heaven to go and resolve some snarl in  the skein of destiny before it can become a serious problem. This is, in fact, a major way for  them to reduce their own Paradox. Okay, cool, but what does that mean? What does a paradox  mission look like? Below are a number of example missions. They can be used either as inspiration, or as a random  pick-a-mission chart for Storytellers who already have enough shit on their plate this week. To  use these missions as inspiration, just read them. To use them as a random generator, start by  rolling a single die. On a result of 1-4, roll again and run one of the corresponding missions from  “Tangled Destinies.” On a result of 5-7, roll again and run one of the corresponding missions  from “Opposed Destinies.” On a result of 8-9, roll again and run one of the corresponding  missions from “Major Destinies.” On a result of 10, roll again and run one of the corresponding  missions from “Legendary Destinies.” Finally, if they fail, roll one last time and consult the Consequences chart to see what happens because of their failure.
Tangled Destinies These are minor snares in the tapestry of Fate, in which the Sidereals are unlikely to face  opposition from anything but the situation itself, but even minor snares need to be resolved lest  they snowball into larger problems later on. Roll a single die and pick a mission from the number  it lands on.
Result The Sidereals must… 1 Aid a merchant in avoiding an ambush; or delay a person’s meeting with their lover; or ensure that a person is in their home at a certain time of a certain day.

10 Ensure that someone kidnaps a wealthy man’s dog; or make sure that a broken temple  bell rings 20 times when a procession leaves a certain house; or ensure that a corpse receives a  proper burial and funeral.
Opposed Destinies These are also lesser complications in weave of the world, but Sidereals must operate within a  framework of meaningful opposition in order to resolve them. Roll a single die and pick a  mission from the number it lands on.
Result The Sidereals must… 1 Smuggle a pendant into a satrap’s palace and hide it in a vase standing next to his throne;  or kidnap a Dynastic household’s seven children and leave them tied up in a particular town  square by dawn; or retrieve a particular skull from a defiled graveyard crawling with hungry  ghosts and burn it upon the altar of a certain temple.
2 Prevent a group of ghosts from establishing themselves in a living city; or see that every  trooper in a field-deployed wing of an imperial legion is fed a hearty and nutritious meal; or ensure that a wedding becomes a riot which burns down at least one entire neighborhood.
3 Hide a new Exalt from the Wyld Hunt until the full moon has come and gone; or arrange  the death of a Dynast’s pregnant wife; or lead a Dragon-Blooded to discover a spy in her  household.
4 Plant flower seeds on seemingly infertile ground and water them until they grow; or lure  a Guild caravan into a raider ambush; or guide a man into a Lunar’s cult.
5 Maintain the illusion that a murdered family is alive until a caravan leaves town; or steal  all documents from an Immaculate temple; or burn down a Manse.

9 Help a child Exalt escape from a malevolent spirit; or destroy a silver mine that belongs  to House Sesus, leaving no survivors; or ensure that a man is chosen to contribute to the making  of a new Yennin.
10 Prevent an unforeseen attack by a second circle demon; or stop a Wyld Hunt from  entering a shadowland through its eastern border; or stop a Fair Folk warband from reaching its  destination.
Major Destinies These are serious errors in the structure of destiny, involving important figures, high stakes, and  often substantial opposition. Roll a single die and pick a mission from the number it lands on.
Result The Sidereals must… 1 Provide a clandestine escort for a Dragon-Blooded through a Lunar dominion; or locate  and detain a rebel Sidereal; or find a Liminal’s severed head and affix it to a Dynast’s body.
2 Pursue a settlement between two conflicting supernatural beings; or stage the murder of  an influential couple without personally dealing the killing blows; or cause a god’s high priest to  turn against her.

7 Secretly switch a poor man’s newborn baby for a Dynasts’s; or find a lost tomb and  ensure that the secret held within falls into the hands of a certain scavenger lord; or cause an  Abyssal to fall in love with a particular mortal.
8 Bring about the destruction of a famous and well-guarded library; or locate a magical  poison and administer it to a sick man currently being healed by a powerful artifact; or reunite a  Ghost-Blooded youth with both of her parents.
9 Lead a caravan astray for a certain period before leading it back to its proper destination;  or participate in a Wyld Hunt and divert it from a newly Exalted Sidereal; or guide a feral  Dragon King to reclaim his intelligence.
10 Prevent the excavation of an old Exalted grave; or convince a fisherman to try to  resurrect his wife; or burn a contract and make sure no one who was present for its signing can  ever speak of it again.
Legendary Destinies These are compound errors in the weave of destiny, usually the result of several lesser failures  compounding. Roll a single die and pick a mission from the number it lands on.
Result The Sidereals must… 1-2 Strike back against a powerful faerie lord who is working with a secret Guild slave ring  to empty out villages and cities at a principality’s border. The lord must die, the fae must not  occupy the empty villages, and the Guild’s involvement must be involved, but the Sidereal may  not spill a drop of blood herself.
3-4 Gather evidence that several major gods are guilty of treason and see them convicted by  one of the Celestial Incarnae.
5-6 Find and destroy a free third circle demon.
7-8 Prevent a catastrophic battle from forming a new shadowland.
9-10 Prevent a Circle of Solars from assassinating a highly influential Dynast and plunging the  Realm into civil war.
Paradox Manifestation If the Sidereals fail in their mission, roll a die and consult the chart below to determine what  happens. If they fail a major mission, add +1 to the result. If they fail a legendary mission, add  +3.
Result Paradox 1-2 Future errors in destiny’s weave compound in a more serious fashion, but there are no  other immediate repercussions.
3-5 Minor paradox. The effects last for only a short period. A drinking party might result in a  riot, even though no wine is present. A man drowns after being pulled safely from the water.
6-7 Serious paradox with substantial ongoing consequences. A politician gives a famous  speech without being present. A fire is not extinguished in time and cannot be extinguished at all,  continuing to spread for hours or days.
8 Disastrous paradox. The paradox is large and massively disruptive. A prince is  assassinated and his nation falls into chaos despite that he still lives. A sorcerer banishes the rain  and it never returns, turning a fertile land into a barren waste.
9 A serious or disastrous paradox, also accompanied by the escape of one or more second  or third circle demons escaping from Hell.
10 Fatal paradox. A sector of reality becomes so badly corrupted that the pattern spiders are  forced to excise it. Roll another die. On a 1-6 result, a large Wyld zone forms where the excised  sector used to be. Minor paradoxes appear intermittently as the effects of the excision ripple out  to affect those disrupted by the removal of important places or people from their particular causal  dependencies. The Sidereals are sure to face formal censure."
